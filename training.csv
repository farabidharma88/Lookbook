"When we talk about innovation, catch phrases like “fall forwards” and “fail fast” get thrown around to nods of agreement in the boardroom. When it comes to taking real risks with ideas, however, directors often talk a much bigger game than they actually play. For change makers who may be working hard to live up to their job title, it’s unwise to approach apathetic stakeholders unprepared. You’re likely to have your idea shot down with a few carefully worded questions before it even gets off the ground.",BUS30
"That’s why, this week, we’re going to explore some ways that you can be more effective at driving change with a few stakeholder persuasion techniques. Convincing people is all about activating your stakeholder’s sensory imagination and breaking down logical barriers. We have a couple of tools in our toolkit to do that:",BUS30
"And by tangible, we mean data-driven. Nothing speaks to your stakeholders like telling them you know how to increase (or decrease!) the numbers that are important to them. If your idea saves time, put a figure on it in hours. If it increases morale, quantify that with survey results. Hard data is the best method you have for making abstract notions feel real.",BUS30
When Buffer pitched their business idea to investors they used hard data on their existing traction to show how the business could generate a return. Check out the slide deck here.,BUS30
"For every benefit associated with your idea, there is a cost in failing to implement it. Pitching your benefits as missed opportunities to the company can be extremely persuasive, especially if you’re able to spin them as boons to your competitors. Paint a picture of the scenario that could happen if you don’t follow through; “I wouldn’t want to be the one reporting those numbers to management…”.",BUS30
"The sad reality is that your stakeholders expect you to fail. Not because they want you to but because they have seen a thousand failed projects before. They need to know that if this project breaks down half-way, it’s not going to disrupt current operations. Stakeholders also want to know how much it will cost them if your plan does go wrong, and at what point they’ll have to cut their losses and abandon it. You’ll need to think about timescales too, with worst-case-scenario timings thought through. Use strong reasoning to show why their nightmare scenario really isn’t all that bad.",BUS30
"It’s essential to remember that the people you’re pitching to probably have a broader, perhaps even a stronger, knowledge of your organisation than you do. That means you’ll want to spend some time carefully identifying the challenges that stand in the way of implementation. Think about the issue from all possible angles, including how changing market conditions might affect your plan. Moz does a really good job of this on slide 25 in their original pitch deck, breaking down the scenarios that could lead to problems.",BUS30
"“I love it, but it’s going to be a hard sell with [X].”",BUS30
We hear this sentiment a lot. Never forget that every stakeholder you’re pitching to has to answer to somebody else. Their decisions are based on how it will make them look as much the actual results they’re able to get. Make sure you factor this into your pitch and think about how your boss’ bosses will view this project.,BUS30
"And, if you can, run it first. It’s always much easier to approach stakeholders with a prototype that works, a process that’s been tested or an idea that’s worked for someone else. Tangible results help your stakeholders to envision a future in which your idea is functional. If you can’t test your idea in real life, at least include a testing procedure alongside your idea pitch. That way, your stakeholders know that you won’t break anything by giving it a go.",BUS30
The likelihood of your superiors signing off on an organisation-wide change after one conversation is extremely low. The reason being that it takes considerable resources to implement anything on a broad scale. That’s not going to happen until you can prove that it works on a much smaller one. Find a way to demonstrate the results you can achieve on a micro-level before you request more buy-in. Stakeholders are much more likely to give lots of small yeses than one large one.,BUS30
"Follow these steps and you’re much more likely to position yourself for a successful idea pitch. Remember, stakeholder buy-in is the key to driving change and making an impact on your organisation.",BUS30

"If you’re like most founders, you probably think about your startup 24/7. You wake up in the morning brainstorming product features, and you fall asleep at night contemplating marketing campaigns. You can’t remember the last movie you saw at the theater; your idea of a fun, Saturday night is collaborating with developers overseas. And stalking VCs on LinkedIn has become a favorite past-time.Passion, hardwork and a healthy amount of obsession are essential ingredients to entrepreneurial success. However, it’s not uncommon for founders to become hyper-focused on initial ideas at the expense of an important fact:",BUS30
A startup founder’s ultimate success is dependent on others buying into his or her vision.,BUS30
"Translation: Your progress is contingent upon your ability to pitch the value of who you are, what you’re doing and why it matters. Reaching important milestones like raising venture capital, sourcing top talent and acquiring new customers all require the same skill — telling a story that makes someone say, “Heck, yeah!” Sometimes you have 30 minutes to make that happen; other times you have 30 seconds. Regardless, your job is to clearly communicate why a given audience should care about your business.",BUS30
"If you are a startup looking to get to traction and funding, check out the Founder Institute pre-seed accelerator program.",BUS30
"One of your most powerful tools in achieving this objective is the pitch deck. Early-stage founders can use templates to create visual presentations that provide brief overviews of business value propositions, market opportunities and metrics. At the Founder Institute, we see dozens of decks every week. The majority of them are completely forgettable because someone overlooked a few essential ingredients to storytelling success.",BUS30
"The reality? Phenomenal pitches aren’t thrown together in a weekend — they are thoughtfully contemplated, tested and refined. In this guide, we’ll make a case for why founders should master both The Elevator Pitch and The 1-Minute Pitch before tackling decks. We’ll also provide guidelines for constructing narratives, customizing pitch deck templates and communicating with potential investors. These are many of the same techniques Founder Institute alumni have used to procure $1.75BN+ in funding. Finally, we’ll conclude with some examples of real decks utilized by globally recognized startups. After reading this guide, you will know exactly what it takes to create a compelling deck, give a memorable presentation and stand out from the crowd. Let’s get started... ",BUS30
,BUS30
Three Types of Startup Pitches,BUS30
"Think back to elementary school: Did your foray into your first language begin with a 1,200-page copy of War and Peace? No, you started by learning simple words. Similarly, you shouldn’t expect to construct “the perfect” pitch deck right away. Instead, begin by constructing the simplest description of your business possible: The Elevator Pitch.",BUS30
,BUS30
"As a startup founder, you will meet hundreds of people at various meetings, events and conferences. You will also, routinely, introduce yourself to complete strangers by email. In such situations, you have seconds to peak someone’s curiosity. And the best way to do that is a compelling Elevator Pitch.",BUS30
"This one-sentence statement explains what you do, who you serve and why it matters in simple language. As the name implies, the summary can quickly be recited to a stranger on an elevator ride.",BUS30
Founder Institute CEO and Co-founder Adeo Ressi has developed an awesome Elevator Pitch template dubbed “Startup Madlibs.”,BUS30
Use the template below to craft your own: Let's go through each of the items,BUS30
"OK, let’s look at a couple of examples…",BUS30
Mediocre Elevator Pitch Example:,BUS30
"My company Socialista,Is developing a revolutionary, social utilityTo help female consumersFind deals online faster. ",BUS30
What’s wrong with this pitch?,BUS30
"Including these details implies the person has done their homework, knows their stuff and has a viable business idea.",BUS30
Improved Elevator Pitch Example:,BUS30
"My company Socialista,Is developing an ecommerce websiteTo help female consumers between the ages of 18-25Shop for hip, baby products at wholesale prices,With automated ordering of diapers and other staples.As you can see, the Elevator Pitch format is deceptively simple. The key to standing out is (a) being super specific, and (b) emphasizing your startup’s “secret sauce.” In this case, the founder’s unique differentiator is providing a fashionable solution at an unusually affordable price. Mastering this exercise is extremely helpful in refining Unique Value Propositions.",BUS30
,BUS30
"Once you’ve articulated your Elevator Pitch, you are ready to move onto the One-Minute Pitch. Here you can add several key details to your Elevator Pitch, including:",BUS30
"Check out the easy-to-use ""One Minute Pitch Template"" from the Founder Institute below: ",BUS30
,BUS30
 ,BUS30
"Before you begin creating your pitch deck, it’s important to consider the perspective of potential investors. Top VCs see and hear dozens of pitches per week, both in-person and via email. Luminary Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) hears from around 3,000 startups each year. How many of those company’s procure investments? Only 15 of them. The current VC landscape is showing bigger deals spread amongst fewer startups. Despite funding reaching its highest levels since 2000, seed-stage investments consisted of only 25 percent of total deals made in 2018. Translation: The competition is tough.",BUS30
,BUS30
Pre-requisites for Pitching to Investors,BUS30
"As Mike Suprovici (Founder Institute EIR) lays out in his Startup Guide: How to Raise the First Round of Funding for Your Startup, before you even begin to approach investors, you need the following:",BUS30
A strong startup idea that is vetted and backed by solid market research. See this startup idea guide from the Founder Institute.,BUS30
"A prototype, a patent, or a proof of concept for the final idea.",BUS30
"A simple and scalable startup financial model that shows at least $10M in revenue after 3 years. See this revenue forecasting template from Aaron Patzer, Founder of Mint.com and FI Mentor.",BUS30
A strong 10 to 15 page presentation that meets investors' expectations. We will discuss this in the section below.,BUS30
"An incorporated entity with a smart capitalization table (""Cap table""). See this simple cap table from Venture Hacks.",BUS30
The ability to quit your job and live for six months on savings while you conclude the financing and launch the business.,BUS30
"Another factor to consider is what kind of investor you are approaching. Consider the stage of your own company, before trying to pitch to certain investors. Do you meet their pre-requisites? If you are raising your first round of funding, then you are likely still at a pre-angel or angel investment stage. As a result, you should NOT try to pitch venture capitalists.",BUS30
,BUS30
What Investors Want to See in a Pitch,BUS30
"If you are ready to pitch angels or venture capitalists, it's critical to understand what those investors are looking for. In order to stand out, your pitch must include both (a) the specific informational components investors are seeking, and (b) a memorable story that illustrates a compelling opportunity. As Jasmine Foroutan, CEO and Founder of Pitch Genius, says, investors want more than rote slideshows:",BUS30
Investors make decisions based on return and risk: How big of a return could they receive? And what might prevent them from receiving that return? Most VCs want a 10-20x return. ,BUS30
"As a founder, your job is to convince investors your startup offers the greatest potential return, with the least amount of risk — in comparison to the others on their list. Generally speaking, investors will evaluate risk in three main areas:",BUS30
,BUS30
"What Makes a Startup ""Fundable""?",BUS30
"During one of Naval Ravikant's (Founder of AngelList) talks at the Founder Institute, he described 'The Anatomy of a Fundable Startup', which you can watch below:",BUS30
,BUS30
"Similarly, when Aaron Patzer (Founder of Mint.com) described his Pitching Secrets to the Founder Institute, he outlined four main questions investors will ask themselves whever they evaluate a startup pitch:",BUS30
"Address those four questions, and you will have a much higher chance of attracting funding from professional investors.",BUS30
,BUS30
"Think of your deck like a visual business plan. Your objective is to succinctly illustrate your marketplace knowledge, business model and qualifications for execution. A standard deck consists of 10 to 14 slides. The most common mistake made by newbie founders? Providing too much detail, too soon. Jenny Lefcourt, General Partner at Freestyle Capital, cautions early-stage founders against making this error:",BUS30
,BUS30
Don’t:,BUS30
Make Two Decks,BUS30
"Many founders are surprised to learn they need two decks: (1) a detailed version that can be shared with investors via email, and (2) a simplified version that can be elaborated upon in person.It’s not uncommon for investors to request to see a deck before agreeing to meet. For this reason, your “reading” version should include enough detail to stand alone. Conversely, a standard deck should be streamlined to ensure investors spend more time listening and less time reading. Most of the presentations available for online viewing showcase “listening” decks. We recommend beginning with the construction of the “reading” deck, which can then be edited for pitch presentations.",BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
"Is there a RIGHT way to organize a pitch deck? The answer is both yes and no. In terms of information provided, there are certain points you absolutely must cover. However, you have creative freedom when organizing and presenting your slides. Here are the four most common types of decks:",BUS30
"The most commonly used pitch deck template is the Problem-Solution Deck, which is ideal for founders with especially unique solutions to widespread problems. ",BUS30
"All four frameworks contain the same informational points, organized in different ways. A variety of templates exist online and can be modified to meet your needs. However, don’t be afraid to venture outside of existing formats, so long as you're including necessary information.",BUS30
"The most compelling elements of your business plan, your unique value proposition (UVP) and your intended audience should all inform how you structure your deck.",BUS30
"With that said, the Problem-Solution Pitch Deck Template is a great place to start. In this section, we’ll walk through all of the elements included in the standard deck: ",BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
1. Cover,BUS30
Announce your big idea — the one thing you do better than anyone else. You have 10 seconds to engage your audience. Include:,BUS30
2. Summary ,BUS30
"Summarize the highlights of your business opportunity, emphasizing minimization of market, product and execution risk. Include:",BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
3. Problem,BUS30
"Describe the problem you solve, who you solve it for and the reasons why your target customer are unsatisfied with current solutions. Include:",BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
4. Solution,BUS30
"Describe your solution and the major benefits it entails. Are current solutions slow, expensive or difficult to use? Are your solutions faster, cheaper and easier to use? Do customers care? Include:",BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
5. Product,BUS30
"Make your product more tangible by illustrating how it works in three simple steps. Utilize screenshots, graphics and/or video. Skip the demo. Depending on your idea, this might be the ideal place to showcase the filing status of important patents. Include:",BUS30
"NOTE: The order of slides 6, 7, 8, 9 can be rearranged to fit your particular narrative.",BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
6. Business Model,BUS30
"Illustrate your primary revenue model. Generally, investors prefer active revenue streams to passive revenue streams. They also, particularly, like recurring revenue streams like monthly and annual subscriptions. Note: Companies that make money via advertising revenue are the exceptions – not the rule. Include:",BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
7. Market Opportunity,BUS30
"Illustrate how much money you could, theoretically, make if you dominate your target market. Many investors like to see both a top-down and a bottom-up analysis. Although bottom-up is more difficult to calculate, including it will increase your credibility. Here’s an article on how to calculate it. Include:",BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
8. Competition,BUS30
"This might be the most important slide of the entire presentation. However, many founders struggle to clearly differentiate their products and services from the competition. Your offering must be SO compelling that users enthusiastically switch from existing solutions. In this slide, your objective is to provide 3-4 reasons why your solutions is superior to both direct and indirect competitors in the marketplace.",BUS30
Warning: Don't make the mistake of saying you have no competitors. Investors will assume your idea isn’t worth pursuing.,BUS30
"Of course, if you’re pioneering a new technology, your competition will be its traditional counterpart. Nonetheless, your job is to clearly compare the differences between the status quo and your game-changing solution. ",BUS30
"You have two options regarding layout: The""Gartner Magic Quadrant"" shown below or the “Competitive Grid” shown above.",BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
9. Growth,BUS30
"Here your objective is to demonstrate your knowledge of customer acquisition, customer retention and product innovation. Investors expect you to know a few key metrics:",BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
10. Traction,BUS30
,BUS30
"This is another important slide that showcases customers love your product and are happy to pay for it. The Traction Slide should seek to mitigate the three types of risk: Market risk, product risk and execution risk.It should suggest that your startup can replicate initial success at scale, decrease future acquisition costs and increase profitability.",BUS30
"Use key metrics[o] to illustrate traction, highlight trends and rates of change. An ideal scenario for investors, for example, might be customer and revenue doubling monthly coupled with declining customer acquisition costs. If you have yet to launch, use this slide to illustrate major milestones in product development, key hires and funding.",BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
11. Financials,BUS30
,BUS30
"How much money do you expect to make within the next 3 to 5 years? Do your best to estimate projected revenue, costs and expenses based on hitting your funding goals. Include:",BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
12. Team,BUS30
"Your Team Slide should mitigate investor concerns about execution. VCs love to see team members who have previously worked with successful startups, similar technologies and in similar markets. Check off as many of those boxes as you can. Note that your Team slide should include every important member of your extended team. This should include founders, key employees, advisors and investors (if any).",BUS30
"Creating an advisory board is a very simple way to add industry expertise to your ""team"" and is something that I strongly recommend For example, being able to drop a line like ""We have the CMO of the largest real estate brokerage in the world on our advisory board"" really boosts your credibility if your are focusing on a real estate opportunity.",BUS30
A second and equally important benefit of advisors is that they can quickly help you refine your business and product vision themselves and connect you to people they know who can do the same. You can also use advisors to add significant technology and startup experience and expertise to your team.,BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
13. Funding,BUS30
"Finally, it’s time to ask for the money you need. Include:",BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
14. Summary,BUS30
"After your presentation finale, end on a copy of your Summary Slide in the background. At this time, you will be fielding remaining questions that have yet to be answered.",BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
15. Appendix,BUS30
"Though not mandatory, some founders include an Appendix with supporting information positive PR, customer testimonials, technological details and/or in-depth financial information.",BUS30
"Remember: Creating a pitch deck isn’t a “one-time exercise.” Practice your pitch often in front of peers, advisors, and mentors. The clearer your messaging becomes, the faster you will close deals.",BUS30
,BUS30
Here are some of Ressi’s best pitch presentation tips:,BUS30
,BUS30
"Investors listen to a ton of pitches, so it is only natural for them to see (and be slightly irritated) by common mistakes.",BUS30
"One of the biggest pet peeves of Manu Kumar, of K9 Ventures, is when presenters say they will answer a question later: ",BUS30
,BUS30
"Over the years, we’ve spoken with several VCs who echo this sentiment — entrepreneurs must demonstrate flexibility, spontaneity and willingness to “jump off” script. You may be eager to talk about your team because it’s in the next slide. However, the investor sitting in front of you may care more about customer acquisition costs. Which is why practicing your pitch in low-stakes situations is SO important. The more familiar you become with addressing unexpected interruptions, the more confidently you will handle diversions in meetings that matters.",BUS30
Adeo Ressi (CEO of the Founder Institute) has something that frustrates him even more: ,BUS30
"See more investor pet peeves from funding experts Manu Kumar of K9 Ventures, James Cham of Bloomberg Beta, Adeo Ressi of the Founder Institute, and Alex Gurevich of Javelin Venture Partners below. ",BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
"The bottom-line: Delivering “the perfect pitch” takes practice. It’s normal to feel nervous before speaking to a room full of strangers. However, the more you do it, the easier it becomes. Founders who wanting to expedite progress should consider joining an intensive accelerator program.",BUS30
,BUS30
Below are some examples of decks and presentations — from both big and small names — that have resulted in funding. Notice the common elements we’ve discussed woven throughout the decks. And take note of any presentation strategies that might be advantageous to your startup:,BUS30
Mint.com,BUS30
"Founder: Aaron PatzerFunding: $31.8M in 5 rounds, acquired by Intuit",BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
Airbnb ,BUS30
"Founders: Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, Nathan BlecharczykFunding: $4.4B in 13 rounds (as of March 2019)",BUS30
"Should you study the pitch presentations of legends like Steve Jobs, Marc Benioff and Elon Musk? Absolutely. However, it’s often helpful to watch entrepreneurs who are less removed from your current stage of business. Below are some pitch presentations from up-and-coming Founder Institute Alumni:",BUS30
,BUS30
1. Pethub ,BUS30
"Pethub is an award-winning software company helping pet owners manage their pets’ lives online. PetHub ID tags are officially in-use by over 250 communities and 20 states in the U.S as their government or shelter issued ID tag, and 98% of PetHub recovered pets are reunited with family without ever entering a shelter. The company has raised several million dollars in funding and is on pace to track and protect over 1 million animals by 2021. Pethub is also a Seattle FI alum, founded by Tom Arnold.",BUS30
,BUS30
2. Spaceishare,BUS30
"SpaceiShare, a Toronto FI company founded by Sarah Selhi, is a marketplace that allows people to offer their empty physical spaces as storage for people who need the room. They secured a sizable deal on on Dragon's Den, and have been featured across Canadian press.",BUS30
,BUS30
"And here is Sarah's presentation on Dragon's Den, where she delivers a modified pitch and fields a very different set of questions: ",BUS30
,BUS30
3. Bridgr,BUS30
"Bridgr, a Montreal FI company founded by Amira Boutouchent, is an online platform that helps small and medium-sized manufacturing companies find and collaborate with validated and qualified independent experts to solve their operations issues, allowing them to grow quickly without the need for expensive and time-consuming consultancies.",BUS30
,BUS30
4. Climber,BUS30
"Climber is a Lisbon FI company founded by Mário Mouraz. They build revenue management software that takes data from external sources, such as weather, air traffic, online shopping, and claims regarding a hotel’s reputation. They cross analyze all of that with information from the hotel user, in order to automatically calculate what to sell and how much to sell it for.",BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
,BUS30
The Founder Institute is here to support ambitious Founders that want to change the world.,BUS30
"The Founder Institute is the world’s most proven network to turn ideas into fundable startups, and startups into global businesses.

"To pitch a journalism or media product is to make the case for your idea to an individual or group in exchange for financial or some other kind of support. Pitching is a dynamic process that requires you to be of two minds. On the one hand, you need to believe in the value of your idea and in your team’s ability to make it viable. On the other hand, you must also demonstrate a capacity for change and perseverance as your idea evolves over time in response to feedback from potential customers and investors. Your pitch must demonstrate that you have a great product idea, that you have done market and competition research, and that you are willing and able to scrap key features, even ones you love, if feedback from customers or investors makes it necessary. Developing a pitch is more than coming up with a great idea for a media product and shopping it around to investors. It involves ideation, key feature identification and testing, market research, design and branding work, redesign, and pitch performance practice. At the heart of the pitch is your promise to develop a successful product, even though you may not yet know all of the variables that will influence its success.",BUS30
"Let’s freeze the conversation for a second for students who are not necessarily interested in being entrepreneurs. “Why should we study ideation, research, project management, and pitching?” You should study this because every job involves pitching. Journalists make story pitches every day and to a growing extent they are expected to provide evidence of engagement on previous similar stories to justify their pitch. For example, they may need to pull data from CrowdTangle or Chartbeat to show that stories about a particular bridge under construction garner a lot of attention and engagement. Stories may not seem sexy at first, but engagement numbers can help a journalist close the deal.",BUS30
"If nothing else, you will need to pitch yourself and your skills on the job market. If you treat your career search as a product to be managed, you will ideate potential outcomes in terms of workplace, location, and job description. You will go into job interviews with a well-researched plan, good-looking supplementary materials including your resume website, and you will know what the competition looks like. You need to understand what your “key features” are as a potential employee. You can refine those and present them well and find a good market fit for the product, i.e. your professional labor.",BUS30
"Studying how to ideate and to pitch is also fun. It’s not a lecture series or a knowledge dump. It’s a guided tour through a process of self discovery, group relationship building, and global market awareness. Even if you never take your own new endeavor to market, learning how to ideate and to pitch could and should change your life.",BUS30
"Pitching can happen formally or informally. An elevator pitch, a short two- or three-sentence description of your idea, is a pitch format you might use to describe your project to a stranger in casual conversation or to a potential team member at a meetup. It is similar to the log line in a film project. This chapter is designed for students who are developing formal pitches for ideas seeking seed funding. For best results, you should already be acquainted with the lean startup model of product development prior to creating your pitch. Developed by Eric Ries,[1] The Lean Startup stresses the value of customer development as its central thesis. In essence, the book states that the business of lean startups is to learn. You learn by practicing a sort of customer service science. Lean startup teams hypothesize about what product changes might work, and they test those changes on real consumers, a.k.a. users, so that the product is always improving, always moving closer to perfect product market fit. It’s an ideal that’s not often attained, but that’s the goal, and you need to be able to explain that you understand this concept and can put it into practice.",BUS30
"You may have begun (for real or in mock exercises) by self-funding the development of a prototype, a.k.a. bootstrapping, and you should have continued through the “friends and family” stage of financing where you have sought funding via personal networks, i.e. your parents, friends, perhaps a rich uncle.",BUS30
"This chapter assumes you have worked through the ideation phase of product development (see chapter on Ideation) and that you’ll continue to make improvements to your product even as you work on your pitch. Your team demonstrates leadership and change management skills by showing how your product has already evolved in response to customer development efforts. Customer development includes doing essential market research, testing features, and gathering and analyzing design feedback. The best pitches impart these nuts-and-bolts elements by demonstrating that your team has learned from this feedback and also convey the team’s passion, ingenuity, and perseverance. When your team has done as much product development and customer development as you can afford, or as time allows during a class session, you build toward a “big ask,” which may be a meeting with investors, a presentation to a startup competition committee, or a pitch contest, etc. This chapter focuses on preparing you for that big presentation, but it also briefly covers preparing an elevator pitch and writing a prospectus paper.",BUS30
"To narrow the scope of the discussion, this chapter identifies six presentation elements that serve as a starting point for pitch preparation. They are:",BUS30
"These are the must-haves for a pitch about ten to fifteen minutes long. Each may be represented by one or more slides if you are crafting a slide deck or by one or more sections if you are writing a prospectus. Depending on your product, presentation type, preferences, and priorities, you should feel free to customize around this framework.",BUS30
"Slide 4: To establish product-market fit, you first have to have a market. The Airbnb pitch deck notes that at the time there were 630,000 users on couchsurfing.com and that there were 17,000 temporary housing listings on Craigslist in San Francisco and New York combined in one week. Thus, there existed a large potential traveler pool and a large pool of people with rooms for lease, but these groups were in need of a unified platform.",BUS30
"Slide 5: The fifth slide details the size of the market and Airbnb’s share, showing potential for growth.",BUS30
"Slide 6: Completing the case for product-market fit, this slide shows the attractive user interface and provides a mini-narrative for how the product works.",BUS30
Slide 7: This slide shows four years’ of revenue totals as simple math: 10 million + trips x $20 average fee = about $200 million in revenues. This is evidence of product-market fit and whets the investor’s appetite for potential future earnings.,BUS30
Slide 8: This slide shows how Airbnb has already beaten its competition to own the market for certain events and to create partnerships.,BUS30
"Slide 9: Here, investors get the full picture of the competition.",BUS30
Slide 10: The financial expectations are pretty well established by this point and were explained verbally. What this shows are the barriers to competition expected to help preserve Airbnb’s position and future earnings and growth expectations.,BUS30
"This chapter focuses first on developing the six presentation elements. When the time comes to build slide decks, the order, breakdown, and prioritization of elements is up to you. You are not expected to finish your product before developing your pitch. Rather, it is strongly suggested that you develop your pitch and your product in parallel.",BUS30
"Your presentation slide deck should begin with a memorable brand image. It can be a logo representing your product in a stylized way, or it could be a screen grab of your product if you are particularly happy with the design. It’s often a good idea to create a tagline as well. It helps drive the message home for investors who want to know right away if they see a marketable idea. From a persuasive standpoint, all you are trying to establish with your first slide is that this is a great product that many people need that’s easy to understand and remember.",BUS30
"Your brand introduction should be kept to one slide and should set the aesthetic tone for the rest of the presentation. Establish a color palette and stick with it. If you’re going to use design elements such as borders, background colors, or shapes, use them in your introductory slide. Go with clean, simple design elements. If something doesn’t add to your presentation, leave it out and keep it out in subsequent slides.",BUS30
"As you present the brand image and tagline visually, your talking points should include a brief description of the team. Don’t feel the need to introduce every member right away. The project manager should introduce the concept and herself or himself, and as the presentation moves on other members of the team can introduce themselves when it’s their turn to speak. There’s no correct way to divide up presentation responsibilities. Different courses and competitions will set requirements for the minimum and maximum number of speakers or group members you should have. Just be sure to keep the introduction slide focused and brief. Whenever it is your turn to speak, identify yourself. Mention your role and very briefly discuss your background as it pertains to your role on this project. Holding off on team introductions will keep your pitch moving.",BUS30
"You should start working on branding at the same time you begin product ideation. Establishing your brand identity is like selecting your best photo and description for a dating app. Put only your best face forward. Give investors a single, interesting, lasting image that they can connect to the rest of your pitch.",BUS30
"Every product solves a problem. Many entrepreneurial media products solve problems that users didn’t know they had. It’s your job to help the investor identify a media-related problem that many people share and then clearly explain in a story or short anecdote how your product solves the problem or, if it is not an outright solution, how it alleviates pain associated with the problem. Look at other problem-solution narratives in advertising and in corporate origin stories for examples of how to craft a quick, compelling problem-solution narrative.",BUS30
Classic Problem-Solution Narratives,BUS30
"These may not be the greatest stories ever told. You’re not going to get a National Book Award for a Snickers commercial, but these are memorable narratives about people who have a problem that the product in question can solve.",BUS30
"You may want to personalize the narrative as it relates to you or someone on your team. This is common practice, but don’t force it. Often, student media entrepreneurs are caught in a quandary. They tend to come up with products suitable for their demographic that may not be massively appealing, or they come up with products for general audiences (read: people of a different generation). Then students may have difficulties crafting a relatable narrative. Your preference should be for creating a viable product and telling the product’s story as well as you can. Use your research and communication skills to craft narratives with a great problem-solution story. If your product is not for people like you, simply identify the type of person who has this problem or this pain point. Create user or customer personas (see Customer Discovery chapter[3]): “fictional, generalized representations of ideal customers.” Explain how your product is a feasible, meaningful solution for her or him. What motivates them to adopt your product? Tell the story in thirty seconds or less, in three slides or fewer.",BUS30
"By the time you create your pitch, you may have developed a concept and wireframe or some other mockup of a minimum viable product (MVP). Often the best way to present this narrative is to tell the problem-solution story verbally while simultaneously demonstrating on a couple of slides precisely where users need to tap or click to fix the problem. If this is a semester project for class, you may not have a prototype ready yet, but you should work to make your mockup look as much like the “real thing” as possible.",BUS30
Try out different narratives on potential customers as part of your customer-development research. Keep internal records of which narratives work best. Ask people why these resonate more than others. You usually do NOT want to spend precious time delving into bullet points about key features at this stage. You can tell investors how the product works later on in the pitch. At this point you are simply a brand that solves a problem a lot of people have. Strive to make the narrative relatable and fun.,BUS30
"During your pitch, consider introducing investors to your key features, your value proposition and, where applicable, your user interface (UI) at the same time. Key features are the specific jobs your product or service accomplishes or assists with. A most basic example is that a bowl is innovative in relation to a plate. Both share the key feature that they hold food. A bowl adds another feature by holding liquids comfortably. Many innovative media products add several key features to solve nuanced problems. Limit yourself to developing a small handful of key features at first. Figure out how they will look and feel and be able to show users how your product’s design is easy to use.",BUS30
"One way to think of your value proposition is as the sum of your key features. How exactly are you solving problems, addressing pain points? The bigger the problem and the simpler the solution set, the more impressive your value proposition is likely to be.",BUS30
"At its core, a value proposition is a statement about why someone needs your product or service. How are you making their life better or making them more wealthy, with “wealth” being broadly defined?",BUS30
"Answer this question in your presentation visually while stating it verbally. Show investors your product or your UI and walk them through two or three tasks that can be accomplished easily. This is a chance to show off your key features and to make your potential investors understand your value proposition so well they become excited to invest and to bring this product with these, or similar, key features to audiences.",BUS30
"Demonstrate your UI or your product’s design in two or three slides. You may prefer to simply show a mock-up against a monochrome background so that the product’s design is all that investors notice. This will make the value proposition pop. Alternately, if you want the slides to carry over an existing set of design elements from the rest of your presentation, try to make the color palette, shape, and line selections for your slide background complement your product’s design elements.",BUS30
"Do not feel the need to introduce every feature or to narrate every design choice, but you should show that you have a good sense of design and that your design will make your key features easy to find and use.",BUS30
"A popular tool for creating wireframes is Balsamiq.[4] You can create mobile and/or web app wireframes that incorporate realistic design elements such as buttons, menus, and media players. You can build a wireframe mockup of your application or web application that users can actually click through and try out. If you work with a clickable wireframe, though, double and triple check that it functions properly on the device you will be using during your “big ask.” If you’re not completely sure that the functions will work, use a static mockup and sell it with your enthusiasm and with evidence of thoughtful, thorough research. If you are pitching a tangible media product, e.g. a wearable, you should bring a physical prototype for investors to try out.",BUS30
"Whatever your combination of digital mockup and tangible prototype is, it is preferable to show something basic that helps investors understand key features rather than show an elaborate mockup on which little or nothing works. Stick to the minimum viable product and keep the mockup clear and simple; however, note that certain startup competitions or investors may require working prototype sites or apps.",BUS30
"Tips for crafting great-looking, useful user interfaces are abundant online. They usually come with collections of colors in “color kits”[5] that serve as pre-determined palettes, and they will also include button and menu design styles for you to choose based on the tone and function of your product. Try out completely different approaches to UI on potential customers. Once you have narrowed down their basic color and design preferences using stock design elements, try creating your own color combinations, button styles, and menu designs. Stay within your users’ stated preferences, but apply your own creativity so that you can truly brand your product as your own.",BUS30
"I allude to the term “iterative development” throughout this chapter, but it merits definition here. Iteration in innovation refers to building out prototypes again and again–first for the developers themselves, then for beta testers, and then for a (hopefully) growing audience. At the root of the concept is repetition, which means the process of designing, building, testing, seeking feedback, re-designing, etc. continues indefinitely. Think, for example of a common platform such as Facebook and how many times it has been redesigned since you or the people you know have been using it.",BUS30
"If you spend even a few months using a favorite platform or app, you will likely see iterations of its development. What you need to know during the entrepreneurial pitch process is that iterating can happen while the pitch is being developed. This is normal and expected. You should seek to iterate based on user data and feedback. Iteration is not guesswork, and it’s not merely trial and error. It’s an informed repetitive development process meant to develop a product-market fit by molding the product to an existing market.",BUS30
"In your team’s pitch so far, you have established a brand, demonstrated through storytelling how it solves a problem, and shown that your team is capable of designing an MVP with a combination of user input and your own creative design skills. You have shown investors that you and your team have a valuable idea and the skills to work in a lean startup environment using an iterative process. Now you must demonstrate how you are going to make money.",BUS30
"The next few slides in your deck should present a brief discussion of product-market fit. In two to three slides, show how big the market is, show where your product fits, and show evidence of iterative development according to customer preferences. Your goal is to quickly show the investors where there is an underserved mass market. Then, you must show that your product can tap that market and reach real customers. Every aspect of the market you are entering is fair game for questions from investors. You can head off killer questions by showing a depth of understanding about the market. There may be many solutions in the marketplace. Do not ignore them. Explain why your solution fits best. Explain that you’re working harder than anyone else to serve customers by directly testing their preferences.",BUS30
"Marc Andreessen of investment firm Andreessen-Horowitz calls product-market fit “the only thing that matters.”[6] Specifically, his commentary is about successful startups and whether team, product, or market matters more. He argues it’s the market. Andreessen says: “In a great market — a market with lots of real potential customers — the market pulls product out of the startup [original emphasis].”[7] None of your creative ideation or inspired design work matters if you can’t demonstrate knowledge of the marketplace. Practicing customer development, then, is establishing a process where you allow consumers to pull great products out of your efforts.",BUS30
"Fit your market research into your presentation in under a minute. Emphasize the size and strength of the potential market in a slide. Then, demonstrate that you have conducted careful customer research to learn what potential users want. You should have data from testing general product ideas, key feature combinations, and design elements. You should be able to show quantitative data, probably from surveys, and qualitative data, probably from focus groups. Present the highlights of customer development in a couple of slides.",BUS30
"Investors only want the summary of this data. Present it in a narrative form. For example: “We have found that our users prefer our social media app because their friends are using it, and as the number of friends using our app increases a certain amount, the amount users spend with the app increases in correlation.” If you’re not able to show that level of correlation in your data, at least be able to show that you are building the most popular version of your idea with key features that users preferred over all other potential features they were shown.",BUS30
"The visuals you use are up to you, but you must establish that there is a market for this kind of product and that you’ve sought to achieve product-market fit by developing a product with direct user feedback. That’s what customer development is all about. For the lean startup, it cannot be stressed enough how important customer development is. It’s not enough to show that you have had some good ideas. You need to show that you can bring your product and its customers together. Products evolve, and so do customer tastes, so you need to show that your team can already work on this product in response to user feedback data.",BUS30
"Your first task in conducting market research is to define the scope of the media market where your product will compete. If you are working on a journalism startup, define a news niche in terms of geography and topic. If your news product focuses primarily on one topic, you will probably need to cover a wide geographical area, perhaps a national market.",BUS30
"If you are planning to bring news to a geographical region, limit it in a logical way. You might determine a reasonable driving radius around your community and cover the counties and cities within, which is essentially what defines a Designated Market Area (DMA) in broadcast news. You might wish to focus more narrowly on a single metro area or suburb.",BUS30
"Use census data to learn everything you can about the people who live in your coverage area. Read broadly about the history of the area, its economic background, and its economic future. Plug into the local entrepreneur scene long before you launch your media startup because understanding the startup market is your key to understanding the economic future of your area.",BUS30
"Most mass media startups that do not focus on journalism serve as communication platforms, games, or information curation/aggregation services. Service-logistics apps of the so-called “sharing economy” help people providing specific services to coordinate with others who need those services. If your team is pitching this type of app, avoid calling your product the “Uber of” something. Uber has become synonymous with corroded corporate culture,[8] and it has proven to be a high-stakes global gamble for investors. The sharing economy model is a difficult sell because the ideas are cheap and execution is expensive. Whatever your product is, you will need to demonstrate that this particular shared service is needed. You can’t expect to rely on sharing economy research in another sector to justify your concept. Nobody needs the “Uber of toothbrushes,” or do they?[9]",BUS30
"After working through the first four presentation elements, students sometimes think that their product’s value is self-evident based on its key features, its design, and the strength of the marketplace. There is a tendency to think that because the processes of designing a product and strategizing about customer development are labor intensive those elements should be enough to demonstrate a product’s value, but investors will look for something more. They will want to know that your media product is not already available elsewhere, offered by someone with more experience and an established customer base. You must demonstrate that your product is unique.",BUS30
"Describe your competition as clearly and directly as possible. Name names. Cite links. Clearly and accurately describe their relevant products and their features. Describe in some detail what they do and don’t do. Know your competitors as well as you know your own brand. In the context of where your targeted markets overlap, know them better than they know themselves. Show that you have looked at trade industry publications detailing your competition’s strategies. Show that you have read, synthesized, and summarized up-to-date industry blogs’ take on your competition, and, most important, show that you understand your competitors’ strategy based on their About Page and design blog, if they have one.",BUS30
"Competitive analysis should be presented in about two slides. Pretending not to notice major players in the field will get you laughed off the presentation stage. You need to note in one slide who your key competitors are in the marketplace. You need to explain how your product or service is unique. What key features do you offer that no one else does? When you have similar features, how do you prioritize them or present them in ways that are unique or more affordable or more tailored to a target audience than the options that already exist? Answer these questions for each competitor.",BUS30
"Demonstrate this knowledge in clean, carefully crafted slides with straightforward storytelling. Neither overestimate nor underestimate the competition. When organizing this section of your slide deck, you are going to have to make executive decisions about what to leave in the presentation and what to cut. Use the “iceberg principle.” Present about one-tenth of the research you have done and be prepared to tailor the competitive analysis of your presentation for each investor or competition keeping in mind that competitors and markets are in flux.",BUS30
"Keep the pace quick and have a strategic counter for beating or at least competing with competitors’ strategies. It’s not enough to list their related products and the key features of those products. Identify the brand strategies so that you can anticipate where your competition is headed. You should be able to answer what you would do if someone new entered the marketplace doing the same thing you’re doing. Explain if this can be prevented. If it can’t, explain with substance how you’re performing better than the competition at delivering a similar product. If that is not possible, you need to come up with a different product. Pivot to target a different market or develop a different feature set. It’s essential that you don’t try to pitch a product that’s already available in the same marketplace (potentially from multiple sellers with more resources and experience).",BUS30
"You can present your competitive analysis by going through one competitor at a time and explaining how you will beat each one, or you can go topic by topic, such as “feature set,” “target market,” “user interface,” “supply chain,” “development costs,” “outcomes,” “branding,” etc. and explain how you will best your competitors on each item. This element of your presentation can easily get convoluted. You may not wish to address all of these elements. If you do good customer development work, you can prioritize which of these aspects of the product matter most to them and limit your competitive analysis discussion based on that research. In this way, customer development is doubly important. It tells you how to focus your own product and tells you where to focus your competitive efforts.",BUS30
"Your competitive analysis needs to evolve as you go through the customer development process. Each time you add or remove a key feature from your product, you must research who else is doing something similar and alter or amend your presentation to show that you’re aware of them and have a plan to beat them.",BUS30
"In about three slides, explain your revenue model, that is, what your customers, advertisers, underwriters, etc., will be paying and what will they be paying for, as well as the costs to deliver those products or services. One of the best ways to express your revenue model is to work with the Business Model Canvas (BMC) (see Business Models chapter for more on this)[10] to map out how money will flow through your organization. The BMC helps you to picture how your startup fits into its financial ecosystem. It enables or forces you to think about who you’re going to work with and how you’re going to work with them to get the resources you need to provide valuable products or services. It helps you to plan to whom exactly you will deliver those services and how you will deliver them, and it demands that you understand what your costs are and where your revenue will really come from. The BMC will inform your estimation of startup costs and operating costs. From those (revenues, startup costs, and operating costs), you can determine your breakeven analysis according to what your class syllabus or competition guidelines require. Groups in media entrepreneurship classes often go through a dozen business model canvas drafts, or more, as they plan and develop their product and as they conduct customer development. The BMC will help you to decide on a revenue model and express it in visual form, though the actual visualization should be tailored to suit your product.",BUS30
"You must indicate how much of your startup funds you have already contributed, if you plan on seeking other funding sources, and what proportion of the business you are going to hand over to investors for the amount of funding you request. You should probably share only a summary of your plan. Spend no more than three minutes presenting realistic, well-thought-out financial estimates. Again, the iceberg approach may be the best approach.",BUS30
"Investors will want to know what basis you have for your financial estimates and claims. Often, this is the part of the presentation that generates the most questions from the audience. Document your sources for any financial assertions you make and be prepared to hand over more detailed business plans if asked. Make the case that your product is a great investment. Practice with mentors, friends, family members, and your professors so that you can make the strongest possible feasible case for funding.",BUS30
"An example of a successful pitch is CardLife featured on this[11] blog post of the 35 best pitch deck examples. It is a tracking company that communicates to users, usually business, how much they are spending on subscription software services. Businesses have a problem. They subscribe to many software solutions. They do so at different times for different amounts for plans that may renew automatically year over year or that may increase in price, sometimes without review. CardLife helps track this expense in order to make it easier for businesses to balance budgets. This is a business that serves other businesses, yes, but it’s also media-related because it gathers, tracks and presents information in a service that’s designed to be easy to use. It’s a time saver and potentially a stress reducer. The slide deck established that this is a problem for businesses by keying in on one number: 93%. That’s the percentage of businesses that fail to keep track of their software and other subscription expenses. In their pitch, they note that 1,000 businesses signed up for their service within six weeks of launch, and they note that they are connecting to a $10 billion industry. Though they cannot plan on receiving a portion of that particular pie, by being connected to such a large market with continued growth potential, they easily make the case that their business is positioned for future growth. Please review their presentation video and slide deck. It’s No. 15 on this list, which includes several other examples of solid slide decks accompanied by videos of each as they were given by the entrepreneurs themselves at Y Combinator 2017.[12]",BUS30
"Let’s start with an anecdote: In our entrepreneurial media management course at Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville, guest judges came one semester and quoted wildly different costs for app development. One estimate was based on an alert app that let students know when on-campus athletic events are being held. Students budgeted tens of thousands of dollars in their plan to build a fully functional app, but the guest judge said he had proposals for similar alert services on his desk that would cost the university about $2,000.",BUS30
"At a pitch competition later the same semester, a different team proposed to a different set of judges to build a new social media platform that would visualize posts and group audiences into “cliques” enabling social media managers to send targeted message to only certain “cliques,” in real time. One judge happened to have served as an adviser to a military contractor who wanted to develop its own social media platform. He had a front-row seat to the proposal, and his company quoted a base price (with a development team of dozens of software developers) at $20 million. Thus, the class was left with a range of costs for “app development” somewhere between $2,000 and $20 million. The best way to estimate costs for an app is to look for something with a similar feature set and find out how much seed money it got in its earliest round or rounds of funding.",BUS30
"Preparing for question and answer sessions with potential investors is something of a challenge because every investor is different. You should anticipate likely questions and be prepared for “wild card” questions by having an open mind and by practicing your pitch in front of different audiences. Vary the age of your pitch audience. Get test audiences that vary in income level and education. Sometimes you are not pitching to the investor but to the investor’s idea of who the consumer for this product must be. Once you have practiced presenting in front of various audiences, you should identify a few likely questions and prepare well-researched answers. You need not promise the world to an investor. But you must be prepared to indicate your plans for improvement, or be able to explain why something that seems like it should be done is not yet done. You should identify known weaknesses in your pitch and prepare reasonable answers regarding your plans to improve upon shortcomings. You may plan to conduct further research where more information is needed, or you may have identified key features that need to be altered or replaced. If you have identified something that needs doing and that isn’t done yet, that may not be a deal breaker as long as you have a reasonable plan for making changes and you show that you are prepared for change.",BUS30
You should also strategize for staying in touch with any potential investors. Task a point person with collecting and organizing investors’ contact information. Make note of each investor’s investing background and interests and take detailed and careful notes about their feedback regarding your pitch. Do your research. You should know any potential investor’s history and strengths and weaknesses. Treat an investor’s individual concerns as the most important keys to your success. Making it work with one real investor ready to cut a check is more important than developing a perfect product pitch for future potential investors.,BUS30
"Generally, cold calls to angel investors are not appreciated. Work carefully immediately after an investor expresses interest in your proposal to open a line of communication. Follow the investor’s preference, which may be for asynchronous communication such as email or SMS, or they may prefer to speak via video chat or by phone.",BUS30
"One goal, perhaps the goal of an initial pitch is to gain enough interest on the part of an investor that she or he wants to hear a second, personalized pitch in the near future.",BUS30
"You are not going to meet your “soulmate” investor the first time out or in any of the first ten times making your pitch. Shoot for a 1 in 100 rate of success at setting up a meeting with a funder. That means that for every 100 contacts you make, one of them might consider funding your business.",BUS30
"There is often a two-step flow to reach an investor. You may need to pitch a surrogate who can get you a meeting with the right investor. As a baseline, you, as a representative of your startup, ought to have an up-to-date LinkedIn profile. You should have a professional Twitter account where you follow and connect with investor networks, and you should plan on attending events with investors and other entrepreneurs through Eventbrite and Meetup.",BUS30
Show up early to events. Stay late. Strategically attend paid events where investors are the invited speaker for a better shot at meeting the right investor. The “right” investor is the one who shoots you down but who knows three or four other investors who are more likely to be interested in your idea or your brand.,BUS30

"If you make your pitch informally 100 times, you will have the opportunity to refine your idea and your informal narrative. You will learn what gets investors excited, how to pace your informal pitch, and you will learn to move away from all-or-nothing formal pitches on the stage to the kinds of informal conversations with connected people who can get you a meeting with the right investor. It is important to learn who the connectors are, who are “all hat and no cattle,” and ultimately you must know what you are asking for: a sit-down meeting with an angel investor who will listen to your idea.",BUS30

Be straightforward and be open to change. Know when to stop selling and listen. Know that you need not point out any flaws in your product when discussing a possible investment. A solid, experienced investor will have noted many or all of the potential flaws, conflicts, and stress points in your product pitch by researching your business before the meet.",BUS30
"Gauging investor interest is important. It is subjective. It takes time and regular, professional communication. You can change mockups and make prototypes with investor input in mind, but you must consider your costs and recognize when an investor is not serious. You do not want to spend more than your startup can afford to alter your product for an investor who is only testing the waters.",BUS30
"How often you communicate with a potential investor depends on their availability, their willingness to communicate, and how many resources you have at your disposal for cultivating relationships. One thing is for sure: You must follow up with potential investors. They will expect you to do so if they have expressed an interest in your proposal.",BUS30
A few somewhat universal goals you might pursue for communicating with interested investors:,BUS30
"There are a few other types of pitch you may wish to prepare or that you may be assigned to develop besides the somewhat standard ten- to fifteen-minute slide deck proposal. The following are examples of longer-form and more brief pitch types: elevator pitches, three-minute pitches, prospectus writing, and nonprofit pitches.",BUS30
"The elevator pitch, or Twitter pitch, should land somewhere between a branding statement and a problem-solution narrative. It should take no longer than a minute to deliver, and in most cases it ought to be memorized. The point of an elevator pitch is to earn a chance to make a longer pitch at a later date at the time and place of the investor’s choosing. Giving an elevator pitch is an art. It’s often done informally at networking events. In movies, these types of pitches are given in bathrooms, on the street, in the firm’s lobby as a courtesy, or, yes, in elevators. In reality, you never know when you might need to give an elevator speech. That’s why you always have it memorized.",BUS30
"Be able to tell a potential investor precisely what your product does, why a mass audience would be interested, and where mass revenues are going to come from. All other aspects of the pitch will be in response to questions—if you can manage to get an investor interested. If you’re asked to write one, make it two to three sentences, or a tweet. Write one that’s easy to memorize so that any member of your team can deliver it and any potential investor can comprehend what the brand is, what you do, and how you plan to make money.",BUS30
"Two- or three-minute pitches are often used at “pitch days” or “speed dating” events where many entrepreneurs and many potential investors or well-connected people meet to hear what’s being developed. Rather than tailoring a deck for a potential investor or for a competition and then reading the audience during the pitch performance, you may need to take a Swiss Army Knife approach and develop a handful of different short, completely scripted pitches to present to different people depending on their role (e.g. investor or journalist), their field (e.g. tech, advocacy, PR), or their attention span.",BUS30
"When startups attend pitch days in front of prospective investors, there is a formulaic approach to the ask. While you may not need to adhere to a script for a slide deck, a solid three-minute pitch can help you attract vendors and suppliers, woo landlords and advertisers, recruit employees, and win over other advocates. And, yes, maybe even investors someday (at which point you’ll revisit that pitch deck).[14]",BUS30
"Craft pitches that are long enough to incorporate a narrative without missing the essentials of the elevator pitch. Joanne Cleaver, writing for Entrepreneur.com, suggests that the three-minute pitch can be tailored to an audience according to this formula: “Get their attention, tell them the right story, and keep ‘em on the hook.”",BUS30
A successful pitch presentation might end with an investor asking for your prospectus. “Prospectus” is a tricky term in the startup world. Prospectus.com spells out all of its potential meanings:,BUS30
"“A prospectus is somewhat used as an interchangeable term. Often a business plan is referred to as a prospectus, as is the private placement memorandum (PPM). In many cases, the prospectus is a public disclosure document that, like the PPM, is used to disclose the company’s data prior to a public listing of securities (with the goal in mind to raise capital publicly). However, prospectuses are also used in the private placement market and often the term itself is employed in lieu of an offering memorandum or a PPM. Referring to your business plan or your private placement memorandum as a ‘prospectus’ is not inaccurate, but it may not be precise [edited for spelling and clarity].”[15]",BUS30
Be sure you know what’s being asked of you if someone asks for a “prospectus.” Have your complete business plan ready in case that’s what an investor really wants to see. It’s much more feasible to break down a business plan into different types of prospectuses depending on who’s making the request than it is to try to turn a legal prospectus into a complete business plan.,BUS30
"“Whether you are raising private capital or set to launch a publicly listed company on a stock exchange, a business plan and a disclosure document is required.”[16] Per prospectus.com, the document needs at a minimum the following information:",BUS30
"For this text, a prospectus refers to a summary of a business plan put in writing that might be used as a disclosure document. There are online aids available that can help you write a business plan, which can be streamlined and used as a prospectus. You should make contact with a lawyer before you make any serious pitches to investors. The best advice may be to use the U.S. Small Business Administration’s tools for crafting a business plan as completely as you can, and then based on a thorough examination of the marketplace and your plans, you can then craft a prospectus.",BUS30
"Nonprofit startups need to make pitches to request funds, and they may still go through the process of bootstrapping, asking friends and family for money, and eventually going to larger investors (i.e. donors, foundations, grantors, etc.) to try to get their business off the ground. In the vast majority of cases, nonprofit organizations will need to identify various revenue sources apart from the initial grantor or foundation if they plan to stay afloat. Thus, nonprofits often have to be grant-managing machines and great pitch developers too. Other ways that nonprofits bring in revenues beyond getting grants include signing up small donors in person at community events, hosting fundraising galas, crowdfunding, making direct mail requests, and sending phone, email, and text requests.",BUS30
"Potential sources of revenue must be described in great detail in any documentation explaining your nonprofit business plan. Other elements should still be included: branding, a problem-solution narrative, communications plans and tools demonstrating your design sense, an analysis of the “competition,” and financial plans. They need to be addressed in terms of terminology and tone to donors and grantors, but at the end of the day the pitch for a nonprofit business has a lot in common with a startup pitch.",BUS30
"The Business Model Canvas mentioned earlier can be used to develop the components of your pitch; however, it shouldn’t be used as a checklist. The sections of the canvas flow into one another and should be considered a strategic whole.[18] Write and edit multiple versions of your business model so that you could make it into a flipbook and animate it if you wanted to.",BUS30
"If your company or university would pay for it, Strategyzer costs $299 per year and allows you to electronically build within the BMC framework and to generate reports based on what you have proposed.[19] The Value Proposition Design text zeroes in on two points of the BMC—the value propositions and customer segments—and breaks down your analysis and development into smaller units that can be profiled, anticipated, and measured to try to achieve the best product market fit as you further develop your actual product and test it with users.[20]",BUS30
"Canvanizer[21] and BMFiddle[22] allow you to digitally build the BMC over and over again. With some practice, either can be a useful tool for applying virtual sticky notes to the BMC. Neither does your thinking for you, but if you’re looking for inspiration, BMFiddle shares the Skype BMC example.[23]",BUS30

"Guy Kawasaki offers good guidelines for using PowerPoint in his 10/20/30 rule.[24] You may have to adjust your presentations for each pitch setting, but these are solid guidelines to start with. Kawasaki says that a slide deck should have 10 slides, the presentation should take about 20 minutes, and the type size should be at least 30-point. Follow these rules to have easily understood PowerPoint presentations that don’t drone on and that conform to investors’ expectations when dealing with startups. The 10-slide structure presented by Kawasaki is a good alternative to the structure presented in this chapter.",BUS30
"Scholars study the art and (social) science of the startup pitch. The discussion here includes brief analyses of research on the use of rhetoric in pitches, the role gender plays in pitch success, and analysis of how entrepreneurs can dress to win. Useful academic research focusing narrowly on entrepreneurial pitches has been done, but the body of pitch research is not nearly as robust as work delving into other aspects of entrepreneurial business management and success.",BUS30
"Plenty of articles have been written about how to pitch. Some may prove useful to you in planning and delivering your pitches, but they usually lack academic rigor. This section is a synthesis of carefully conducted social science research that has gone through peer review. Assumptions were tested. Findings are backed by detailed evidence, and limitations are acknowledged directly in detail.",BUS30
"Research regarding rhetoric in pitch presentations covers a variety of areas. This is an interesting area of study for scholars of rhetoric because pitch competitions and television shows are fertile ground for looking at what works in contemporary persuasive speech. One key concept is “impression management.”[25] In a recent publication in the Journal of Business Venturing, Parhankangas and Ehrlich examine down to the word “How entrepreneurs seduce business angels.” They looked at what words or types of words helped entrepreneurs actually secure funding and found that there may be optimal points in terms of numbers of words to put in your pitch deck for employing “positive language” (nine words), for self-promotion regarding your ability to innovate (2.8 words), for referencing your own weaknesses (3.5 words), and for “blasting” the competition (3.3 words). This serves as a reminder that these things – referencing your innovativeness, your weaknesses and your competition’s failings – are good to do in a pitch, but you probably shouldn’t overdo it. There seems to be, at least based on one study, a “Goldilocks”[26] point beyond which you don’t want to step.",BUS30
"Stay positive, and reference your skills and failings and your competition’s major weaknesses without overdoing it. Another paper on rhetoric and the entrepreneurial pitch looks at how Korean entrepreneurs reconfigured their pitch decks when participating in a competition designed to bring already successful Korean products to American markets. The entrepreneurship program studied here is intense. Program organizers and their staff do “actual market research for each company’s product, and the competition’s winners receive actual business development that has historically led to actual deals.”[27] The authors of this paper probably use the word “actual” so often because they want to stress that this is not a paper about “merely academic” concepts.",BUS30
"They analyzed initial pitch decks and final decks of fourteen teams that completed the program: “a full cycle of activity: application to the program, initial pitches, initial feedback from program personnel, detailed feedback from representative stakeholders in the target market, and revised pitches.” Product claims changed as teams went through the program: “There is a change in wording or details to provide more evidence-based and benefit-oriented language.” At times, questions raised in the feedback process were directly addressed in rebuttal slides showing an engagement in the process that reached beyond trying to perfect the pitch deck. When entrepreneurial pitch development programs are running at top speed, so to speak, entrepreneurs show they can think strategically about their product, their market, and how to communicate to all types of audiences the value of their solution and their approach to solving problems.",BUS30
"Another article, published in IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, analyzed frames used by entrepreneurs and how they are developed.[28] Here, “frame” is a way of talking about something that helps connect your understanding of an object, product, or event with other people’s understanding and values. The article states, “The entrepreneur acquired the most influential frames through stakeholder discussion, applied these frames in a way that stacked and made salient multiple frames beyond the problem-solution frame, and judged frame fit by considering the degree to which catchers took up the frames.” The author calls investors and stakeholders in this study “catchers” to stress that they are the ones pitches are directed to. It’s important that they understand, so it can help to use multiple frames.",BUS30
"Problem-solution is just one frame you can use. What this means for students is that the way you describe your product will probably evolve as you talk about it with stakeholders, and it should probably evolve in ways that are meaningful to them. It’s okay to stack frames if you need to. You can work to come up with different, specific terms that help define your innovation in different contexts for different groups. The example in this paper framed the innovation – a nonprofit organization called Hacker Gals – as a collection of hackers who know about computers, makers who get things done, and women who have unique perspectives in the startup world. The combination of frames helped the paper’s author, who also runs the startup, to communicate better with more stakeholders. Ultimately, more specificity emerged as she reworked her pitches: “Specificity and salience appeared to be, in other words, directly proportional.” Thus, one thread tying all these rhetorical analyses together is that specificity is important in entrepreneurial pitches, but it doesn’t come only from the minds of the pitch team. It comes as a result of working and reworking the pitch with stakeholders and mentors.",BUS30
"Lakshmi Balachandra, Anthony Briggs, Kimberly Eddleston, and Candida Brush studied how gender affects the way entrepreneurial pitches are perceived.[29] They did not find that being female absolutely precluded an entrepreneur from finding funding, but they did find that “gendered expectations do make a difference as women entrepreneurs who present masculine behaviors are more likely to be evaluated positively than those who do not.” The authors continue, “Interestingly we find women entrepreneurs have stronger communication skills, but rates of women’s entrepreneurial participation remain weaker than men’s.” The authors suggest that this is because investors, generally speaking, are males who prefer to see so-called “masculine behavior,” characterized as “bold,” “attentive,” “[demonstrating] self-assurance,” “calm,” and “confident,” in women giving entrepreneurial pitches.",BUS30
"The authors go on to say: “Consistent with liberal feminist theory, women do face bias in terms of the masculine stereotype held by the majority of the male-dominated investment community: During the pitch, women should ‘act’ like men and indicate masculine behaviors or they may be penalized by investor audiences to not have the qualities they believe to be consistent with entrepreneurship.”[30]",BUS30
"Students shouldn’t interpret this article simply as a plea to female entrepreneurs to “Pitch Like a Man” in early-stage pitch presentations, to reference the title of this article. Social structures setting the norms for pitch analysis need to change. Investors must become aware of their own biases and retrain themselves to analyze pitches on their own merits rather than on the gender of the people making the pitch. Scholars and advocates are better positioned to demand these changes than entrepreneurs begging for startup funds in an environment where the success rate is very low.",BUS30
"The quality of a pitch presentation is subjective. Investors and judges will notice when a pitch lacks quality, but they might not care to or be able to discern if it was the style of dress or style of presentation that spoiled the deal. Your dress and your performance can obviously influence whether or not your pitch is successful, but there are not many hard and fast rules. Web resources are filled with advice on how to dress and whether or not you should wear formal business attire, business-casual attire, or even casual attire. What’s essential is that you research what pitch competition calls for or what the investor prefers. Just ask how formal the context of the presentation is and dress accordingly. If it’s a competition, look for media from previous events showing how previous winners were dressed.",BUS30
"There’s not a deep pool of academic research on what to wear to your pitch presentation, but scholars have shared a clear idea of what doesn’t work: “Casual dress and nonchalance have a negative influence on investors’ evaluations.”[31] Do the research that allows you to dress to suit the occasion. When in doubt, wear a business suit and jacket. You can always set the jacket aside and lose the tie or your most formal accessories, e.g. Mom’s pearls, if needed.",BUS30
"There is a better body of work on performance and what works. Jeffrey Pollack, Matthew Rutherford, and Brian Nagy reviewed 113 successful pitches from the TV shows Shark Tank and Dragons’ Den (Canada’s answer to Shark Tank).[32]",BUS30
"They had students rate these successful pitches and noted that those who were more prepared received more funding, and they found that perceptions of legitimacy had to be present for this relationship to work. This suggests that merely being over-prepared isn’t enough to secure the most funding. An entrepreneur must be prepared and legitimate to survive the sharks. What comprises legitimacy? In this study, it was a wide variety of concepts ranging from the founder’s level of experience to the business’ likelihood of gaining good media attention. Additionally, showing strong management skills, existing resources, and likelihood of gaining endorsements helped.",BUS30
"Even if investors don’t want to acknowledge it, the quality of the pitch makes a difference. Studies show that investors often say their decisions are based on rational elements of the business and the plan presented to them. However, an article titled “The Impact of Entrepreneurs’ Oral ‘Pitch’ Presentation Skills on Business Angels’ Initial Screening Investment Decisions” suggests otherwise:",BUS30
"“Presentational factors (relating to the entrepreneurs’ style of delivery, etc.) tended to have the highest influence on the overall score an entrepreneur received as well as on business angels’ level of investment interest. However, the business angels appeared to be unaware of (or were reluctant to acknowledge) the influence presentational factors had on their investment-related decisions: the stated reasons for their post-presentation intentions were focused firmly on substance-oriented non-presentational criteria (company, market, product, funding/finance issues, etc.).”[33]",BUS30
"How do you show preparedness? Melissa Cardon, Cheryl Mitteness, and Richard Sudek suggest that it’s essential the pitch team demonstrates that it understands the larger context of the market and social conditions for their product. “Not surprisingly, our results confirm that entrepreneurs seeking funding from angel investors need to have a strong opportunity and be perceived as competent. More important, beyond these factors, entrepreneurs appear to be able to increase their chances of receiving funding if they are able to signal to potential investors that they are prepared, meaning they have thought through the big picture and impact of their product or service and are able to answer questions with confidence and without appearing defensive.”[34]",BUS30
"This suggests that for your pitch performance to land, you need to demonstrate not just that you understand how your business model works but that you understand how all similar business models work, what the economic conditions in the related field need to be, and whether those conditions are present.",BUS30
"The research of Sean Williams, Gisela Ammetller, Inma Rodríguez-Ardura, and Xiaoli Li finds (based on a study of a small sample) that different cultural values are evident in the entrepreneurial pitches made in different countries.[35] Even if you’re not presenting outside of your most comfortable cultural sphere, it may be in your best interests to learn about the values of the organization, angel or judges you’ll be pitching to and speak to those values to maximize your success. These scholars considered entrepreneurial values in pairs, e.g. some entrepreneurs tend to focus on the motivation of profits while others focused more on autonomy. Some tend to promote individualism while others show the strength of their networks. Some focus on learning while everyone (in this small study) discussed action. The country-by-country breakdown in this study’s results is somewhat murky, but these pairings ought to be helpful for you to consider what kind of entrepreneur you are. Identify your values and communicate them. Look for investors and competitions that are trying to achieve the same things with their entrepreneurial efforts.",BUS30
"There is more to life than PowerPoint, but Prezi gives people headaches. If you must use PowerPoint, generate a branded deck format or, perhaps better yet, let the product design lead the way and have a plain deck background. Avoid extensive use of bullet points. Illustrate every number that appears in your presentation. A dollar amount belongs in context. You should either demonstrate expected growth or expenditures or represent your target market, for example, as a small piece of a relatively large mass media pie.",BUS30
"Alternatives to the traditional deck include Perspective by Pixxa, which allows you to represent and animate data, and Haiku Deck, which includes lots of propriety art elements and a startup pitch template — not for professionals but perhaps good for novices getting right to work. Slidebean is good for producing pitches and testing online because it has built-in support for analytics and tracking. Wideo, an animation development app, can be used to completely stack and time a deck with various animations within and between sides.",BUS30
"Spinuzzi, et al. developed another paper on pitch deck development and noted that in intensive pitch competitions entrepreneurs are quite limited in how they can adjust their decks. Consider yourself lucky if you can develop your product and your pitch at the same time so that feedback on your pitch is simultaneously feedback on your innovation. In the same article, authors identified three ways pitch decks are most often altered. The structure of the deck may change—slides can be added and deleted. The claims and evidence may be clarified or strengthened, and the level of audience engagement may be tweaked. Consider judging yourself on these three areas as a good, overarching, holistic approach to determining what, if anything, you can improve on as you work to perfect your pitch.",BUS30

"Most executives believe that competing through business models is critical for success, but few have come to grips with how best to do so. One common mistake, the authors’ studies show, is enterprises’ unwavering focus on creating innovative models and evaluating their efficacy in standalone fashion—just as engineers test new technologies or products. However, the success or failure of a company’s business model depends largely on how it interacts with those of the other players in the industry. (Almost any business model will perform brilliantly if a company is lucky enough to be the only one in a market.) Because companies build them without thinking about the competition, companies routinely deploy doomed business models.",BUS18
"Moreover, many companies ignore the dynamic elements of business models and fail to realize that they can design business models to generate winner-take-all effects similar to the network externalities that high-tech companies such as Microsoft, eBay, and Facebook often create. A good business model creates virtuous cycles that, over time, result in competitive advantage.",BUS18
"Smart companies know how to strengthen their virtuous cycles, undermine those of rivals, and even use them to turn competitors’ strengths into weaknesses.",BUS18
"There has never been as much interest in business models as there is today; seven out of 10 companies are trying to create innovative business models, and 98% are modifying existing ones, according to a recent survey. ",BUS18

"This is neither strategy nor tactics; it’s using business models to gain competitive advantage. Indeed, companies fare poorly partly because they don’t recognize the differences between strategy, tactics, and business models.",BUS18
,BUS18
"Strategy has been the primary building block of competitiveness over the past three decades, but in the future, the quest for sustainable advantage may well begin with the business model. While the convergence of information and communication technologies in the 1990s resulted in a short-lived fascination with business models, forces such as deregulation, technological change, globalization, and sustainability have rekindled interest in the concept today. Since 2006, the IBM Institute for Business Value’s biannual Global CEO Study has reported that senior executives across industries regard developing innovative business models as a major priority. A 2009 follow-up study reveals that seven out of 10 companies are engaging in business-model innovation, and an incredible 98% are modifying their business models to some extent. Business model innovation is undoubtedly here to stay.",BUS18
"That isn’t surprising. The pressure to crack open markets in developing countries, particularly those at the middle and bottom of the pyramid, is driving a surge in business-model innovation. The economic slowdown in the developed world is forcing companies to modify their business models or create new ones. In addition, the rise of new technology-based and low-cost rivals is threatening incumbents, reshaping industries, and redistributing profits. Indeed, the ways by which companies create and capture value through their business models is undergoing a radical transformation worldwide.",BUS18
"Yet most enterprises haven’t fully come to grips with how to compete through business models. Our studies over the past seven years show that much of the problem lies in companies’ unwavering focus on creating innovative models and evaluating their efficacy in isolation—just as engineers test new technologies or products. However, the success or failure of a company’s business model depends largely on how it interacts with models of other players in the industry.

Because companies build them without thinking about the competition, they routinely deploy doomed business models. ",BUS18
A business model comprises choices and consequences. ,BUS18
"Our research also shows that when enterprises compete using business models that differ from one another, the outcomes are difficult to predict. One business model may appear superior to others when analyzed in isolation but create less value than the others when interactions are considered. Or rivals may end up becoming partners in value creation. Appraising models in a stand-alone fashion leads to faulty assessments of their strengths and weaknesses and bad decision making. This is a big reason why so many new business models fail.",BUS18
"Moreover, the propensity to ignore the dynamic elements of business models results in many companies failing to use them to their full potential. Few executives realize that they can design business models to generate winner-take-all effects that resemble the network externalities that high-tech companies such as Microsoft, eBay, and Facebook have created. Whereas network effects are an exogenous feature of technologies, winner-take-all effects can be triggered by companies if they make the right choices in developing their business models. Good business models create virtuous cycles that, over time, result in competitive advantage. Smart companies know how to strengthen their virtuous cycles, weaken those of rivals, and even use their virtuous cycles to turn competitors’ strengths into weaknesses.",BUS18
"“Isn’t that strategy?” we’re often asked. It isn’t—and unless managers learn to understand the distinct realms of business models, strategy, and tactics, while taking into account how they interact, they will never find the most effective ways to compete.",BUS18
"Everyone agrees that executives must know how business models work if their organizations are to thrive, yet there continues to be little agreement on an operating definition. Management writer Joan Magretta defined a business model as “the story that explains how an enterprise works,” harking back to Peter Drucker, who described it as the answer to the questions: Who is your customer, what does the customer value, and how do you deliver value at an appropriate cost? 
    ",BUS18
"Other experts define a business model by specifying the main characteristics of a good one. For example, Harvard Business School’s Clay Christensen suggests that a business model should consist of four elements: a customer value proposition, a profit formula, key resources, and key processes. Such descriptions undoubtedly help executives evaluate business models, but they impose preconceptions about what they should look like and may constrain the development of radically different ones.",BUS18
"Our studies suggest that one component of a business model must be the choices that executives make about how the organization should operate—choices such as compensation practices, procurement contracts, location of facilities, extent of vertical integration, sales and marketing initiatives, and so on. Managerial choices, of course, have consequences. For instance, pricing (a choice) affects sales volume, which, in turn, shapes the company’s scale economies and bargaining power (both consequences). These consequences influence the company’s logic of value creation and value capture, so they too must have a place in the definition. In its simplest conceptualization, therefore, a business model consists of a set of managerial choices and the consequences of those choices.",BUS18
"Companies make three types of choices when creating business models. Policy choices determine the actions an organization takes across all its operations (such as using nonunion workers, locating plants in rural areas, or encouraging employees to fly coach class). Asset choices pertain to the tangible resources a company deploys (manufacturing facilities or satellite communication systems, for instance). And governance choices refer to how a company arranges decision-making rights over the other two (should we own or lease machinery?). Seemingly innocuous differences in the governance of policies and assets influence their effectiveness a great deal.",BUS18
"Consequences can be either flexible or rigid. A flexible consequence is one that responds quickly when the underlying choice changes. For example, choosing to increase prices will immediately result in lower volumes. By contrast, a company’s culture of frugality—built over time through policies that oblige employees to fly economy class, share hotel rooms, and work out of Spartan offices—is unlikely to disappear immediately even when those choices change, making it a rigid consequence. These distinctions are important because they affect competitiveness. Unlike flexible consequences, rigid ones are difficult to imitate because companies need time to build them.",BUS18
"Take, for instance, Ryanair, which switched in the early 1990s from a traditional business model to a low-cost one. The Irish airline eliminated all frills, cut costs, and slashed prices to unheard-of levels. The choices the company made included offering low fares, flying out of only secondary airports, catering to only one class of passenger, charging for all additional services, serving no meals, making only short-haul flights, and utilizing a standardized fleet of Boeing 737s. It also chose to use a nonunionized workforce, offer high-powered incentives to employees, operate out of a lean headquarters, and so on. The consequences of those choices were high volumes, low variable and fixed costs, a reputation for reasonable fares, and an aggressive management team, to name a few. (See “Ryanair’s Business Model Then and Now.”) The result is a business model that enables Ryanair to offer a decent level of service at a low cost without radically lowering customers’ willingness to pay for its tickets. ",BUS18
This depiction of Ryanair’s business model in the 1980s highlights the airline’s major choices at the time: offering excellent service and operating with a standardized fleet. The airline was forced to redesign its business model in the face of stiff competition. ,BUS18
"Ryanair’s current business model rests on the key choices of offering customers low fares and providing nothing free. The rigid consequences include a reputation for fair fares and low fixed costs. Ryanair’s choices are aligned with its goals, generate cycles that reinforce the business model, and are robust given that it has been operating as a low-cost airline for 20 years. ",BUS18

"Not all business models work equally well, of course. Good ones share certain characteristics: They align with the company’s goals, are self-reinforcing, and are robust. (See the sidebar “Three Characteristics of a Good Business Model.”) Above all, successful business models generate virtuous cycles, or feedback loops, that are self-reinforcing. This is the most powerful and neglected aspect of business models. ",BUS18
How can you tell if a business model will be effective? A good one will meet three criteria. ,BUS18
"The choices made while designing a business model should deliver consequences that enable an organization to achieve its goals. This may seem obvious until you consider a counterexample. In the 1970s, Xerox set up Xerox PARC, which spawned technological innovations such as laser printing, Ethernet, the graphical user interface, and very large scale integration for semiconductors. However, Xerox PARC was notoriously unable to spawn new businesses or capture value from its innovations for the parent due to a distressing lack of alignment with Xerox’s goals. ",BUS18
"The choices that executives make while creating a business model should complement one another; there must be internal consistency. If, ceteris paribus, a low-cost airline were to decide to provide a level of comfort comparable to that offered by a full-fare carrier such as British Airways, the change would require reducing the number of seats on each plane and offering food and coffee. These choices would undermine the airline’s low-cost structure and wreck its profits. When there’s a lack of reinforcement, it’s possible to refine the business model by abandoning some choices and making new ones. ",BUS18
"A good business model should be able to sustain its effectiveness over time by fending off four threats, identified by Pankaj Ghemawat. They are imitation (can competitors replicate your business model?); holdup (can customers, suppliers, or other players capture the value you create by flexing their bargaining power?); slack (organizational complacency); and substitution (can new products decrease the value customers perceive in your products or services?). Although the period of effectiveness may be shorter nowadays than it once was, robustness is still a critical parameter.",BUS18
"Our studies show that the competitive advantage of high-tech companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Intel stems largely from their accumulated assets—an installed base of iPods, Xboxes, or PCs, for instance. The leaders gathered those assets not by buying them but by making smart choices about pricing, royalties, product range, and so on. In other words, they’re consequences of business model choices. Any enterprise can make choices that allow it to build assets or resources—be they project management skills, production experience, reputation, asset utilization, trust, or bargaining power—that make a difference in its sector.",BUS18
"The consequences enable further choices, and so on. This process generates virtuous cycles that continuously strengthen the business model, creating a dynamic that’s similar to that of network effects. As the cycles spin, stocks of the company’s key assets (or resources) grow, enhancing the enterprise’s competitive advantage. Smart companies design business models to trigger virtuous cycles that, over time, expand both value creation and capture. 
    ",BUS18
"For example, Ryanair’s business model creates several virtuous cycles that maximize its profits through increasingly low costs and prices. (See the exhibit “Ryanair’s Key Virtuous Cycles.”) All of the cycles result in reduced costs, which allow for lower prices that grow sales and ultimately lead to increased profits. Its competitive advantage keeps growing as long as the virtuous cycles generated by its business model spin. Just as a fast-moving body is hard to stop because of kinetic energy, it’s tough to halt well-functioning virtuous cycles. ",BUS18
Cycle 1: Low fares >> High volumes >> Greater bargaining power with suppliers >> Lower fixed costs >> Even lower fares ,BUS18
Cycle 2: Low fares >> High volumes >> High aircraft utilization >> Low fixed cost per passenger >> Even lower fares ,BUS18
Cycle 3: Low fares >> Expectations of low-quality service >> No meals offered >> Low variable costs >> Even lower fares,BUS18
"However, they don’t go on forever. They usually reach a limit and trigger counterbalancing cycles, or they slow down because of their interactions with other business models. In fact, when interrupted, the synergies work in the opposite direction and erode competitive advantage. For example, one of Ryanair’s cycles could become vicious if its employees unionized and demanded higher wages, and the airline could no longer offer the lowest fares. It would then lose volume, and aircraft utilization would fall. Since Ryanair’s investment in its fleet assumes a very high rate of utilization, this change would have a magnified effect on profitability.",BUS18
"It’s easy to see that virtuous cycles can be created by a low-cost, no-frills player, but a differentiator may also create virtuous cycles. Take the case of Irizar, a Spanish manufacturer of bodies for luxury motor coaches, which posted large losses after a series of ill-conceived moves in the 1980s. Irizar’s leadership changed twice in 1990 and morale hit an all-time low, prompting the new head of the company’s steering team, Koldo Saratxaga, to make major changes. He transformed the organization’s business model by making choices that yielded three rigid consequences: employees’ tremendous sense of ownership, feelings of accomplishment, and trust. The choices included eliminating hierarchy, decentralizing decision making, focusing on teams to get work done, and having workers own the assets. (See the exhibit “Irizar’s Novel Business Model.”) ",BUS18
"When Irizar—a Spanish cooperative that manufactures luxury motor coach bodies—created a radically different business model, it made several innovative choices. ",BUS18
"These choices have led to innovation, high quality, and excellent service, generating high sales volume as well as customer loyalty.",BUS18
"Irizar’s main objective, as a cooperative, is to increase the number of well-paying jobs in the Basque Country, so the company developed a business model that generates a great deal of customer value. Its key virtuous cycle connects customers’ willingness to pay with relatively low cost, generating high profits that feed innovation, service, and high quality. In fact, quality is the cornerstone of Irizar’s culture. Focusing on customer loyalty and an empowered workforce, the company enjoyed a 23.9% compound annual growth rate over the 14 years that Saratxaga was CEO. Producing 4,000 coaches in 2010 and generating revenues of about €400 million, Irizar is an example of a radically different business model that generates virtuous cycles.",BUS18
"It’s easy to infuse virtuousness in cycles when there are no competitors, but few business models operate in vacuums—at least, not for long. To compete with rivals that have similar business models, companies must quickly build rigid consequences so that they can create and capture more value than rivals do. It’s a different story when enterprises compete against dissimilar business models; the results are often unpredictable, and it’s tough to know which business model will perform well.",BUS18
"Take, for instance, the battle between two of Finland’s dominant retailers: S Group, a consumers’ cooperative, and Kesko, which uses entrepreneur-retailers to own and operate its stores. We’ve tracked the firms for over a decade, and Kesko’s business model appears to be superior: The incentives it offers franchisees should result in rapid growth and high profits. However, it turns out that the S Group’s business model hurts Kesko more than Kesko’s affects the S Group. Since customers own the S Group, the retailer often reduces prices and increases customer bonuses, which allows it to gain market share from Kesko. That forces Kesko to lower its prices and its profits fall, demotivating its entrepreneur-retailers. As a result, Kesko underperforms the S Group. Over time, the S Group’s opaque corporate governance system allows slack to creep into the system, and it is forced to hike prices. This allows Kesko to also increase prices and improve profitability, drive its entrepreneur-retailers, and win back more customers through its superior shopping experience. That sparks another cycle of rivalry.",BUS18
"Companies can compete through business models in three ways: They can strengthen their own virtuous cycles, block or destroy the cycles of rivals, or build complementarities with rivals’ cycles, which results in substitutes mutating into complements.",BUS18
"Companies can modify their business models to generate new virtuous cycles that enable them to compete more effectively with rivals. These cycles often have consequences that strengthen cycles elsewhere in the business model. Until recently, Boeing and Airbus competed using essentially the same virtuous cycles. Airbus matched Boeing’s offerings in every segment, the exception being the very large commercial transport segment where Boeing had launched the 747 in 1969. Given the lumpiness of demand for aircraft, their big-ticket nature, and cyclicality, price competition has been intense. 
    ",BUS18
"Companies can often strengthen their business models to take on competitors more effectively. Airbus’s business model initially fell short because Boeing could reinvest profits from its 747, which enjoyed a monopoly in the very large commercial transport segment. In 2007, Airbus launched the 380 to compete in that segment—strengthening its virtuous cycle relative to Boeing’s. ",BUS18
"Historically, Boeing held the upper hand because its 747 enjoyed a monopoly, and it could reinvest those profits to strengthen its position in other segments. Analysts estimate that the 747 contributed 70 cents to every dollar of Boeing’s profits by the early 1990s. Since R&D investment is the most important driver of customers’ willingness to pay, Airbus was at a disadvantage. It stayed afloat by obtaining low-interest loans from European governments. Without the subsidies, Airbus’s cycle would have become vicious.",BUS18
"With the subsidies likely to dry up, Airbus modified its business model by developing a very large commercial transport, the 380. To dissuade Airbus, Boeing announced a stretch version of the 747. However, that aircraft would cut into the 747’s profits, so it seems unlikely that Boeing will ever launch it. Not only does the 380 help maintain the virtuousness of Airbus’s cycle in small and midsize planes, but also it helps decelerate the virtuousness of Boeing’s cycle. The increase in rivalry suggests that the 747 will become less of a money-spinner for Boeing. That’s why it is trying to strengthen its position in midsize aircraft, where competition is likely to become even tougher when sales of the 380 take off, by developing the 787.",BUS18
"Some companies get ahead by using the rigid consequences of their choices to weaken new entrants’ virtuous cycles. Whether a new technology disrupts an industry or not depends not only on the intrinsic benefits of that technology but also on interactions with other players. Consider, for instance, the battle between Microsoft and Linux, which feeds its virtuous cycle by being free of charge and allowing users to contribute code improvements. Unlike Airbus, Microsoft has focused on weakening its competitor’s virtuous cycle. It uses its relationship with OEMs to have Windows preinstalled on PCs and laptops so that it can prevent Linux from growing its customer base. It discourages people from taking advantage of Linux’s free operating system and applications by spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the products.",BUS18
"In the future, Microsoft could raise Windows’ value by learning more from users and offering special prices to increase sales in the education sector, or decrease Linux’s value by undercutting purchases by strategic buyers and preventing Windows applications from running on Linux. Linux’s value creation potential may theoretically be greater than that of Windows, but its installed base will never eclipse that of Microsoft as long as the software giant succeeds in disrupting its key virtuous cycles.",BUS18
"Rivals with different business models can also become partners in value creation. In 1999, Betfair, an online betting exchange, took on British bookmakers such as Ladbrokes and William Hill by enabling people to anonymously place bets against one another. Unlike traditional bookmakers who only offer odds, Betfair is a two-sided internet-based platform that allows customers to both place bets and offer odds to others. One-sided and two-sided businesses have different virtuous cycles: While bookmakers create value by managing risk and capture it through the odds they offer, betting exchanges themselves bear no risk. They create value by matching the two sides of the market and capture it by taking a cut of the net winnings.",BUS18
"Over the past decade, Ladbrokes’ and William Hill’s gross winnings have declined, so Betfair has hurt them, but not as much as expected. Because Betfair has improved odds in general, gamblers lose less money. They then place more wagers, and when bookies pay out, bettors gamble again, feeding a virtuous cycle. This has expanded the British gambling market by a larger proportion than just the improvement of odds might suggest. The better odds Betfair offers also help traditional bookmakers gauge market sentiment more accurately and hedge their exposures at a lower cost. When a new business model creates complementarities between competitors, it is less likely that incumbents will respond aggressively. The initial reaction from bookmakers to Betfair was hostile, but they have become more accommodating of its presence ever since.",BUS18
"No three concepts are of as much use to managers or as misunderstood as strategy, business models, and tactics. Many use the terms synonymously, which can lead to poor decision making.",BUS18
"To be sure, the three are interrelated. Whereas business models refer to the logic of the company—how it operates and creates and captures value for stakeholders in a competitive marketplace—strategy is the plan to create a unique and valuable position involving a distinctive set of activities. That definition implies that the enterprise has made a choice about how it wishes to compete in the marketplace. The system of choices and consequences is a reflection of the strategy, but it isn’t the strategy; it’s the business model. Strategy refers to the contingent plan about which business model to use. The key word is contingent; strategies contain provisions against a range of contingencies (such as competitors’ moves or environmental shocks), whether or not they take place. While every organization has a business model, not every organization has a strategy—a plan of action for contingencies that may arise. 
    ",BUS18
"Consider Ryanair. The airline was on the brink of bankruptcy in the 1990s, and the strategy it chose to reinvent itself was to become the Southwest Airlines of Europe. The new logic of the organization—its way of creating and capturing value for stakeholders—was Ryanair’s new business model.",BUS18
"Changing strategic choices can be expensive, but enterprises still have a range of options to compete that are comparatively easy and inexpensive to deploy. These are tactics—the residual choices open to a company by virtue of the business model that it employs. Business models determine the tactics available to compete in the marketplace. For instance, Metro, the world’s largest newspaper, has created an ad-sponsored business model that dictates that the product must be free. That precludes Metro from using price as a tactic.",BUS18
"Think of a business model as if it were an automobile. Different car designs function differently—conventional engines operate quite differently from hybrids, and standard transmissions from automatics—and create different value for drivers. The way the automobile is built places constraints on what the driver can do; it determines which tactics the driver can use. A low-powered compact would create more value for the driver who wants to maneuver through the narrow streets of Barcelona’s Gothic Quarter than would a large SUV, in which the task would be impossible. Imagine that the driver could modify the features of the car: shape, power, fuel consumption, seats. Such modifications would not be tactical; they would constitute strategies because they would entail changing the machine (the “business model”) itself. In sum, strategy is designing and building the car, the business model is the car, and tactics are how you drive the car.",BUS18
"Strategy focuses on building competitive advantage by defending a unique position or exploiting a valuable and idiosyncratic set of resources. Those positions and resources are created by virtuous cycles, so executives should develop business models that activate those cycles. That’s tough, especially because of their interactions with those of other players such as competitors, complementors, customers, and suppliers that are all fighting to create and capture value too. That’s the essence of competitiveness—and developing strategy, tactics, or innovative business models has never been easy.",BUS18
"A business model is a framework for how a company will create value. Ultimately, it distills the potential of a business down to its essence. A business model answers fundamental questions about the problem you are going to solve, how you will solve it, and the growth opportunity within a given market.",BUS18
"Creating a successful business model is essential, whether you are starting a new venture, expanding into a new market, or changing your go-to-market strategy. You can use a business model to capture fundamental assumptions and decisions about the opportunity in one place, setting the direction for success. ",BUS18
"Business models and business plans are both important tools that help you create and refine your strategy. Many times you will use both when pursuing a new business initiative, but they each serve a different purpose.",BUS18
"A business model is the foundation for your company and products. It captures the main idea of how your business will generate revenue. A business plan goes into greater detail — it is a document that explains how you will make the business model work. Your business plan will likely include your company's goals, the resources and methods you will use to achieve those goals, and even your expected timelines and financial performance. Together, your business model and business plan describe the intended value of your product and how you plan to deliver this value to your customers.",BUS18
"There are many types of business models. Each one varies considerably based on the type of organization and offering. For example, a manufacturing company will have a very different model than an advertising agency. Even within a specific industry, business models vary. ﻿﻿Here are some common types of business models used by technology companies:",BUS18
Freemium business model: A basic product is provided for free but you charge for additional services or features.,BUS18
Free trial business model: Customers can experience the full product for free for a limited amount of time. ,BUS18
Licensing business model: Technology or innovations are monetized by licensing them to other companies. ,BUS18
Open-source business model: Your product is free but you generate revenue through other means such as crowdsourcing.,BUS18
Subscription business model: Customers pay a recurring fee to access your product or service.,BUS18
Most businesses end up using a combination of business models to reach their customers and grow over time. ,BUS18
"There are numerous business model examples to choose from, and the optimal business model will vary for each company — depending on the industry you are in and the problem you are trying to solve for your customers. ",BUS18
"Some types of business models are more popular and work better for certain industries than others. For example, Software as a Service (SaaS) companies often use subscription and freemium business models. This makes software more accessible to customers while providing valuable recurring revenue for the business. On the other hand, many social media platforms use hidden revenue business models to make money through advertising. By providing full access to the platform for free, these companies attract more users. In turn, this creates a more valuable audience for advertisers.",BUS18
"It is also worth considering the types of business models your competitors use. Say that your competitor uses a subscription business model with no free options. If you offer a freemium model, you may be able to attract new customers (including some of your competitor's customers) who prefer to try a product for free before purchasing. In this example, choosing a different business model from your competition could give your company an advantage.",BUS18
"Ultimately, the best business model for your company depends on what is right for your product and your customers. But whether you use a business model example template or invent a new one, building out a business model takes significant research, planning, and analysis. ",BUS18
"Companies across every industry and at all stages of maturity use business plans and models. Some rely on lengthy processes and build complicated models, while others move quickly to articulate the basics. Having the discipline to work through this planning tool forces internal alignment.",BUS18
"For established enterprises, a business model is often a living framework that is reviewed and adapted every year based on changes with customers, employees, and the market. For companies launching new products and services or entering new markets, a business model can help get them off to the right start and ensure that early product and marketing decisions are tied back to the business strategy.",BUS18

The term business model refers to a company's plan for making a profit. It identifies the products or services the business plans to sell, its identified target market, and any anticipated expenses. Business models are important for both new and established businesses. They help new, developing companies attract investment, recruit talent, and motivate management and staff. Established businesses should regularly update their business plans or they'll fail to anticipate trends and challenges ahead. Business plans help investors evaluate companies that interest them.

"
A business model is a high-level plan for profitably operating a business in a specific marketplace. A primary component of the business model is the value proposition. This is a description of the goods or services that a company offers and why they are desirable to customers or clients, ideally stated in a way that differentiates the product or service from its competitors.
",BUS18
"
A new enterprise's business model should also cover projected startup costs and financing sources, the target customer base for the business, marketing strategy, a review of the competition, and projections of revenues and expenses. The plan may also define opportunities in which the business can partner with other established companies. For example, the business model for an advertising business may identify benefits from an arrangement for referrals to and from a printing company.

Successful businesses have business models that allow them to fulfill client needs at a competitive price and a sustainable cost. Over time, many businesses revise their business models from time to time to reflect changing business environments and market demands.

When evaluating a company as a possible investment, the investor should find out exactly how it makes its money. This means looking through the company's business model. Admittedly, the business model may not tell you everything about a company's prospects. But the investor who understands the business model can make better sense of the financial data.
",BUS18
"
A common mistake many companies make when they create their business models is to underestimate the costs of funding the business until it becomes profitable. Counting costs to the introduction of a product is not enough. A company has to keep the business running until its revenues exceed its expenses.
",BUS18
"
One way analysts and investors evaluate the success of a business model is by looking at the company's gross profit. Gross profit is a company's total revenue minus the cost of goods sold (COGS). Comparing a company's gross profit to that of its main competitor or its industry sheds light on the efficiency and effectiveness of its business model. Gross profit alone can be misleading, however. Analysts also want to see cash flow or net income. That is gross profit minus operating expenses and is an indication of just how much real profit the business is generating.
",BUS18
"
The two primary levers of a company's business model are pricing and costs. A company can raise prices, and it can find inventory at reduced costs. Both actions increase gross profit. Many analysts consider gross profit to be more important in evaluating a business plan. A good gross profit suggests a sound business plan. If expenses are out of control, the management team could be at fault, and the problems are correctable. As this suggests, many analysts believe that companies that run on the best business models can run themselves.

There are as many types of business models as there are types of business. For instance, direct sales, franchising, advertising-based, and brick-and-mortar stores are all examples of traditional business models. There are hybrid models as well, such as businesses that combine internet retail with brick-and-mortar stores or with sporting organizations like the NBA.
",BUS18
"
Each business plan is unique within these broad categories. Consider the shaving industry. Gillette is happy to sell its Mach3 razor handle at cost or for a lower price in order to get steady customers for its more profitable razor blades. The business model rests on giving away the handle to get blade sales. This type of business model is actually called the razor-razorblade model, but it can apply to companies in any business that sells a product at a deep discount in order to supply a dependent good at a considerably higher price.

Joan Magretta, the former editor of the Harvard Business Review, suggests there are two critical factors in sizing up business models. When business models don't work, she states, it's because the story doesn't make sense and/or the numbers just don't add up to profits.﻿﻿ The airline industry is a good place to look to find a business model that stopped making sense. It includes companies that have suffered heavy losses and even bankruptcy.
",BUS18
"
For years, major carriers such as American Airlines, Delta, and Continental built their businesses around a hub-and-spoke structure, in which all flights were routed through a handful of major airports. By ensuring that most seats were filled most of the time, the business model produced big profits. But a competing business model arose that made the strength of the major carriers a burden. Carriers like Southwest and JetBlue shuttled planes between smaller airports at a lower cost. They avoided some of the operational inefficiencies of the hub-and-spoke model while forcing labor costs down. That allowed them to cut prices, increasing demand for short flights between cities.
",BUS18
"
As these newer competitors drew more customers away, the old carriers were left to support their large, extended networks with fewer passengers. The problem became even worse when traffic fell sharply following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001.﻿﻿ To fill seats, these airlines had to offer more discounts at even deeper levels. The hub-and-spoke business model no longer made sense.
",BUS18
"
Consider a comparison of two competing business plans where two companies rent and sell movies. Both businesses made $5 million in revenues after spending $4 million on their inventories of movies. This means that each company makes a gross profit calculated as $5 million minus $4 million, or $1 million. They also have the same gross profit margin, calculated as 20% of gross profit divided by revenues.
",BUS18
"
But things change with the arrival of the internet. Company B decides to stream movies online instead of renting or selling physical copies. This change disrupts the business model in a positive way. The licensing fees don't change, but the cost of holding inventory goes down considerably. In fact, the change reduces storage and distribution costs by $2 million. The new gross profit for the company is $5 million minus $2 million, or $3 million. The new gross profit margin is 60%. Meanwhile, Company A fails to update its business plan and is stuck with a lower gross profit margin. As a result, its sales begin to slide downwards. Company B isn't even making more in sales, but it has revolutionized its business model, and that has greatly reduced its costs.

"The first component of your business model is a basic description of your strategy. Your vision can be as short as a few sentences long and can ultimately be part of your company's mission statement. When creating a vision, be sure to clearly state the industry your business is in and use positive language.",BUS18
"Once you have established a vision for your company, determine what your top quantifiable goals are and how you plan to evaluate them. Your objectives can relate to your yearly sales revenue, operating costs, marketing strategies or staffing decisions. If your business is relatively new, it may be best to set modest goals. If your company is well-established, you can set more ambitious objectives, such as expanding customer reach to other states or countries.",BUS18

"When devising a business model, it's important to identify the types of customers who would be interested in your organization's products or services. This component also includes creating a list of challenges your target customers may face while consuming your company's offerings. For example, if your business sells gardening equipment such as lawnmowers, it's important to clearly explain to customers what steps to take if the product they bought is defective.",BUS18
"A strong business model also includes a list of solutions for your customers' issues. Try to ensure that these solutions are realistic by considering the resources you have at your disposal. For example, if your company sells high-tech fitness equipment and some customers experience issues with your products, you can prompt them to complete surveys to better understand why these problems are arising. You can also seek help from a business consultant to come up with solutions.",BUS18
"Value, as it relates to business models, refers to the central aspects of your solutions that make them unique. For example, if your company is the first in your industry to manufacture a revolutionary technology—such as a watch that measures your body temperature in the electronics industry—you can become a pioneer in the field and set new standards for innovation. Value can also include treating your business's employees and customers with respect by paying attention to their needs and concerns.",BUS18
"Every business must establish a pricing model for its products or services. If your company is new, try initially setting prices that are low enough to attract customers but high enough to cover overhead expenses and operating costs. Other factors to consider when setting prices include the quality of your products or services and your profitability targets. Once you have reached your desired net profit margins, you can start offering discounts and other special deals.",BUS18

All in all, it’s an important part of starting up your own business. For example, if you’re looking for investors or a bank loan, putting together a business model will help you to articulate clearly what your product or service is about and how it will succeed.",BUS18
 ,BUS18
"It is the description of what your product or service does to fulfill the customers’ needs. It should clearly define why a customer would buy from your company. The value proposition should be personalized and customized to include the reduction of product search, discovery costs on price, and how you’ll manage product delivery.",BUS18
 ,BUS18
"This portion relates to how you plan to make money from your business through revenue and producing a good return on capital invested. It could potentially include advertising revenue, subscription revenue, transaction fees, sales revenue, and affiliate revenue. The type of revenue you bring in depends on your business, of course, but whatever your income plan is, it’s important to lay it out clearly for yourself and investors.",BUS18
 ,BUS18
"You want to lay out your company’s market space and include your target market and the overall number of people in this audience. If there is a lot of demand for your services/products across a large demographic, it warrants creating a business around this demand. In addition, the market opportunity allows you and others to understand the potential financial possibilities, and it’s essential to do enough research to have realistic financial numbers.",BUS18
 ,BUS18
"If you’ve determined that you have a large target audience, you also want to ensure that the market isn’t saturated with your product or service. For example, you want to figure out who your competition is. Who is offering a similar product or service in your market space? Then, find out who they are and how big they are. Know their market shares, what they provide, and how much they charge for the product they sell.",BUS18
 ,BUS18
"By knowing who your competition is, what they offer, and how much they charge, you can work to differentiate yourself from them. First, figure out how you’re different to encourage customers to choose your company. It might be selling a similar product or service for less or having a specific company culture that resonates with people. ",BUS18
 ,BUS18
"You want to figure out how you plan to enter the market and attract customers, so it’s important to know how you will make your first impression. It needs to be a well-thought-out process, and you may wish to follow a sales funnel process. ",BUS18
"Think of your target audience and how you can reach them with the most impact. You may choose to use social media influencers, do a campaign with a social media platform that makes the most sense for your business, and, of course, create a brand. ",BUS18
 ,BUS18
"It’s also imperative to organize how your business will run to avoid chaos and keep things streamlined. You want to have organizational structures in place as this will help ensure that essential work is completed. In addition, you want to have a process that defines functions in the workplace, which will make it easy for employees to understand their roles and help them be as efficient as possible. Finally, organization development will directly influence how satisfied your customers are as orders and support are dispatched as quickly as possible.",BUS18

"This business model aspect will explain the experiences and background that a company leader should look for. Whether you have your management team together or not, you want to consider what you need from them. If you have a strong team, they can change the business model and the business when necessary. Knowing how to pivot gives a management team credibility to investors. ",BUS18
"The business model you create will ensure your business is set up properly from the very beginning. It will help your business run smoothly, and it also helps get investors to believe in your company. This business model consists of all the aspects an investor or bank will want to look at. So, properly setting it up shows these investors that you know what you’re doing and have looked at all factors.

"Got a new business idea, but don’t know how to put it to work? Want to improve your existing business model? Overwhelmed by writing your business plan? There is a one-page technique that can provide you the solution you are looking for, and that’s the business model canvas. ",BUS18
"In this guide, you’ll have the business model canvas explained, along with steps on how to create one. All business model canvas examples in the post can be edited online.",BUS18
A business model is simply a plan describing how a business intends to make money. It explains who your customer base is and how you deliver value to them and the related details of financing. And the business model canvas lets you define these different components on a single page.  ,BUS18
The business model canvas is a strategic management tool that lets you visualize and assess your business idea or concept. It’s a one-page document containing nine boxes that represent different fundamental elements of a business.  ,BUS18
"The business model canvas beats the traditional business plan that spans across several pages, by offering a much easier way to understand the different core elements of a business. ",BUS18
"The right side of the canvas focuses on the customer or the market (external factors that are not under your control) while the left side of the canvas focuses on the business (internal factors that are mostly under your control). In the middle, you get the value propositions that represent the exchange of value between your business and your customers. ",BUS18
"The business model canvas was originally developed by Alex Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur and introduced in their book ‘Business Model Generation’ as a visual framework for planning, developing and testing the business model(s) of an organization. ",BUS18
"There are nine building blocks in the business model canvas and they are customer value proposition, customer segments, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key partners, key activities, and cost structure. ",BUS18
"When filling out a business model canvas, you will brainstorm and conduct research on each of these elements. The data you collect can be placed in each relevant section of the canvas. So have a business model canvas ready when you start the exercise.  ",BUS18
Let’s look into what the 9 components of the BMC are in more detail.,BUS18
These are the groups of people or companies that you are trying to target and sell your product or service to. ,BUS18
"Segmenting your customers based on similarities such as geographical area, gender, age, behaviors, interests, etc. gives you the opportunity to better serve their needs, specifically by customizing the solution you are providing them. ",BUS18
"After a thorough analysis of your customer segments, you can determine who you should serve and ignore. Then create customer personas for each of the selected customer segments. ",BUS18
There are different customer segments a business model can target and they are; ,BUS18
Use STP Model templates for segmenting your market and developing ideal marketing campaigns  ,BUS18
"Visualize, assess, and update your business model. Collaborate on brainstorming with your team on your next business model innovation.",BUS18
"In this section, you need to establish the type of relationship you will have with each of your customer segments or how you will interact with them throughout their journey with your company. ",BUS18
There are several types of customer relationships,BUS18
"You can understand the kind of relationship your customer has with your company through a customer journey map. It will help you identify the different stages your customers go through when interacting with your company. And it will help you make sense of how to acquire, retain and grow your customers. ",BUS18
This block is to describe how your company will communicate with and reach out to your customers. Channels are the touchpoints that let your customers connect with your company. ,BUS18
Channels play a role in raising awareness of your product or service among customers and delivering your value propositions to them. Channels can also be used to allow customers the avenue to buy products or services and offer post-purchase support. ,BUS18
There are two types of channels ,BUS18
"Revenues streams are the sources from which a company generates money by selling their product or service to the customers. And in this block, you should describe how you will earn revenue from your value propositions.  ",BUS18
"A revenue stream can belong to one of the following revenue models,",BUS18
There are several ways you can generate revenue from,BUS18
"What are the activities/ tasks that need to be completed to fulfill your business purpose? In this section, you should list down all the key activities you need to do to make your business model work. ",BUS18
"These key activities should focus on fulfilling its value proposition, reaching customer segments and maintaining customer relationships, and generating revenue. ",BUS18
There are 3 categories of key activities;,BUS18
This is where you list down which key resources or the main inputs you need to carry out your key activities in order to create your value proposition. ,BUS18
There are several types of key resources and they are ,BUS18
Key partners are the external companies or suppliers that will help you carry out your key activities. These partnerships are forged in oder to reduce risks and acquire resources. ,BUS18
Types of partnerships are,BUS18
"In this block, you identify all the costs associated with operating your business model. ",BUS18
"You’ll need to focus on evaluating the cost of creating and delivering your value propositions, creating revenue streams, and maintaining customer relationships. And this will be easier to do so once you have defined your key resources, activities, and partners.  ",BUS18
Businesses can either be cost-driven (focuses on minimizing costs whenever possible) and value-driven (focuses on providing maximum value to the customer). ,BUS18
"This is the building block that is at the heart of the business model canvas. And it represents your unique solution (product or service) for a problem faced by a customer segment, or that creates value for the customer segment.",BUS18
"A value proposition should be unique or should be different from that of your competitors. If you are offering a new product, it should be innovative and disruptive. And if you are offering a product that already exists in the market, it should stand out with new features and attributes. ",BUS18
Value propositions can be either quantitative (price and speed of service) or qualitative (customer experience or design). ,BUS18
"Once you have completed your business model canvas, you can share it with your organization and stakeholders and get their feedback as well. The business model canvas is a living document, therefore after completing it you need to revisit and ensure that it is relevant, updated and accurate. ",BUS18

Description,GOPPROF-05
"Let's talk about product management KPIs and metrics. We live and work today in a world that is increasingly data-driven, but we cannot successfully adopt a data-driven approach to decision making without first identifying the metrics that matter most.In business, when faced with decisions, there’s far less “Because I think or feel like…” and far more “Because I crunched the numbers and they told me to.” Product management intuition is still a great thing to develop, but statistics and analytics will help you hone your product sense and justify your decisions to stakeholders.Plus, there’s no shortage of tools to help us quantify seemingly everything. As product managers, data is especially important at work where key metrics and KPIs are vital signs to our organizations and products. The right product metrics give us a read on the health of our product, help us identify strengths and weaknesses, track improvement over time, diagnose problems, etc.In order to make data-informed decisions or quantitatively validate ideas, we must first have numbers to work with. Collecting data is no longer a issue - there’s no shortage of tools out there to grab every metric you want. The real issue is lack of focus. With big data comes big responsibility; before we can (responsibly) use data, we must understand and identify the metrics that matter most to our product vision, customer needs, and company goals.Michael Rutledge a Product Manager at American Express describes the data predicament well, “So the challenge becomes, with all this data how can we use it all effectively? I’ve seen companies that run in circles over and over again because they can’t get clarity and agreement on what metrics matter. It can become a sickness when there are too many metrics flying around and some are going up, others going down, and actions are paralyzed because there’s too much discussion about whether some test has illustrated an improvement or not. This is sometimes called analysis paralysis.”So how do we know what data we should be paying attention to? What are the metrics that actually matter?",GOPPROF-05
"You could set out to measure everything related to your product if you really wanted to, and you’d likely have no trouble collecting the data with the seemingly infinite analytics and tracking tools available right now. However, the fewer the metrics you chase, the more focus you (and your organization) will have. In fact, some businesses have taken metric minimalism to the extreme by adopting the idea of the “One Metric That Matters.”",GOPPROF-05
"“This isn’t an excuse to ignore other parts of your business, or to cease efforts to collect all of the important data your business generates. Instead, the one metric is a line you draw in the sand, a commitment you make, for one day, one month, one year, however long you need to optimize your company’s performance based on that metric.” Henry Hund, Director of Marketing and Growth at RJMetrics explains.",GOPPROF-05
"When you’re trying to focus on a single metric to drive your entire business, you obviously want to make sure you’ve chosen wisely. Oftentimes looking at a rate or ratio is a better bet than an absolute number because it gives you something to compare it to over time and ask yourself, “are we doing better, worse of the same?”Ben Yoskovitz, VP of Product at Golnstant says cohort analysis is one thing to consider, “‘Increased conversion from last week’ is better than ‘2% conversion.’ The key here is cohort analysis, where you track a metric over different groups of people, typically over different periods of time. For example, you drive traffic to your site through Google AdWords and measure conversion for a week. But you also measure engagement and churn down the road for those users. ",GOPPROF-05
"Then you make a change (to your website, product, or something else) and track those numbers for another batch of people. Each group of people visiting and signing up is a cohort.”Of course, focusing on a single metric will probably be a little too broad to create anything truly actionable (though it can provide an excellent focus point to rally the entire company around.) In some cases, adopting a less extreme variation of the “One Metric That Matters” approach is a viable option; instead of picking a single metric to rule them all, you could identify a single metric for each facet of your product (i.e. adoption, retention, usage, revenue, service).",GOPPROF-05
"While some metrics might be fascinating and useful to you or to your engineering team, you’ll need to be reporting up and out in your organization as well. You should know your audience and what matters to them because it’s critical that you measure and communicate the metrics that stakeholders and other decision makers within your organization need to see.",GOPPROF-05
"‍Which metrics do stakeholders care about? According to Tim Platt, a Product Manager at American Express, it can get a little personal at times, “It’s a metric on which you will be scrutinized and against which you will need to show how you are moving the needle or influencing it in a manner that is desirable. They’re the things you need to be moving the needle on to ensure you stay funded or to show your leadership that the world you’re doing is delivering value both to the business and also the end users of your product, the two are intertwined. Satisfying, acquiring and engaging users benefits the business and a successful business benefits your product.” (Source.)Sure, when you think about what’s important to your executive team and other functions within your company resource consumption, customer satisfaction, Net Promoter Scores, and other topics may come up. But ultimately, stakeholders care about cash. ",GOPPROF-05
"‍Whether it’s an indicator of how much you’re making today or how much you’re going to make in the future, monetary metrics matter.In fact, financial metrics such as revenue will always be the most important KPIs of any product. “Some people may object to money being the central purpose of a product… but since money pays for salaries, electricity, office space, health benefits, taxes etc, the success of the product must somehow be traceable to this,” says Anders Linsdorf, CEO of Sensor Six, noting that revenue, margins, and equity are particularly important.Your product’s business model will also influence key metrics. If your product has a subscription model, its key metrics (or more accurately, vital signs) are retention rate and churn rate. These are the yin and yang of any subscription business and will tell you how many customers are still happy to keep paying up and how many customers are voting with their feet. Your retention rate is the percentage of customers who stick around at the end of a subscription cycle or term by renewing their contract, while churn refers to the percentage of customers who do not stick around; the percentage of customers who cancel or simply don’t renew.“Retention rate and churn rate should again be based on the typical term length and billing period, so if you are dealing in enterprise SaaS, retention rate is number of customers who extended their contract in the period / number of customers whose contracts where up for extension. Churn rate is 1 – retention rate.” advises Lars Trieloff, Director of Product Management at Blue Yonder.Stakeholders are also going to care about Average Revenue Per User (RPU), Customer Lifetime Value (LTV), gross margins and a host of usage data (total users, monthly/daily users, monthly/daily active users and average session time). These are the kind of metrics you need to be reporting up and the ones that most closely align what you’re doing as a product manager and the overall direction of the business.",GOPPROF-05
"While the previous set of metrics we discussed are key to the business, there’s another set of measurables that are far closer to the PM's heart - metrics that help you understand how customers are interacting with your product and identify opportunities to improve.",GOPPROF-05
"The list can get lengthy, and can be really specific to the nature of your business and products. When looking at feature and usage metrics, you need to not only identify what you WANT to know but what COULD you know. Having more data to play with in this arena is usually a good thing because you can test different hypothesis for correlations, but you can reserve reporting for only the data that pertains to the goals you’re currently pursuing.“It’s most important to track the metrics related to your top goals. Avoid the temptation to add “interesting stats” to your list. Will you actually use these numbers to help you make a decision? Do you really need to track them over time, or is a current snapshot sufficient? Stay focused on the metrics that are closely related to your goals to avoid unnecessary implementation effort and dashboard clutter.” Kerry Rodden, a User Experience Researcher at Google says in a blog post on Google Ventures’ blog.",GOPPROF-05
"An understanding of what your users are doing and how they are using your product is an invaluable tool throughout the product development process, and should be one of the cornerstones of your measurement strategy.User engagement metrics are particularly helpful when it comes to understanding how users interact with your product, writes Evgeny Lazarenko, a Data Analyst at Paktor, “A good starting point for user engagement and behavior analysis is to trace how often your users log in to their accounts. What also helps is to conduct the same analysis for a cohort of users over time.” (Via Quora.) But, these metrics must tell a story in order to be useful to you and your team.Let’s say you decide to measure average sessions per user per month and noticed it's increasing. That’s not a stat you can exactly drop in a PowerPoint and send to the management team by itself; instead you should be accompanying that data point with the answer to the “why” question that you know will follow the pending celebration. What changed and how can you leverage that elsewhere?“The whole point is to learn as you go, then reinvest this information to make better product decisions down the road. If all you know is whether your investment was successful, but you don't know why, then you won't know what your next investment should be, and eventually your luck will run out” says Ben Foster on PM Rant.",GOPPROF-05
"Waiting to define your key metrics until after your product has shipped and someone gets curious is not exactly a recipe for success. If you wait this long, you will have already missed your opportunity to start measuring from a known baseline (of zero) and it may not be possible (or practical) to tack on measuring capabilities to something once it’s already in the wild.Don’t ship anything until you’ve identified the metrics that matter, advises Tim Platt, a product manager at American Express, “Make metrics part of your definition of ready i.e. the criteria that you assess your user stories against in order to determine whether they can be considered defined and ready to be consumed by your scrum team. It’s a great way of forcing yourself as a product owner to ensure everything you do is measurable where possible and your product team will truly value it.”Pro Tip: build metrics testing into your QA process to make sure the data you’re collecting is accurate in a lab setting before you start trying to quantify the unknown.",GOPPROF-05
"Obviously, the metrics most in demand by stakeholders relate to sales; conversions, funnels, performance against targets and forecasts, customer acquisition costs…you get the point. These are all great stats that product managers should be intimately aware of, however these metrics have nothing (or very little) to do with your product itself.Even if you had to get involved in making the reports for this data happen, let sales report their stats and stick to talking about your product. It’s a matter of focus; don’t fall into the trap of reporting on the successes and failures of sales and marketing unless you are actually responsible for some of those areas. Keep your focus on what you do control: your product.Don’t know what to talk about? Mike Smart of Pragmatic Marketing suggests highlighting your product’s speed to market and the competitive landscape: “As an example, speed-to-market is a metric that can be tracked in several ways. How fast did we reach the market with new product releases compared to last year? How many times did we beat the competition to market with comparable product releases? Where do we rank within our industry segment? Over time, we learn what effect improving this measurement has on increasing revenue. Every team member should understand these relationships and how their projects and key activities affect the outcome of the operational drivers.”",GOPPROF-05
"Finally, it can be really easy to point the barrel of your metric making at your internal processes and performance vs. how your actual products are doing in meeting your business’s goals. If HR or your manager is making you track how long it takes you write a spec or how many user stories you create a month then you might need to include a bit of navel-gazing into your analytical approach to work, but don’t confuse what a great (or lousy) product manager you are with whether or not your product is kicking butt or falling behind.Quantifying the outcome of all your hard work--your product and its performance--is more important than attempting to quantify “how the sausage is made.” As Ken Allred, Founder & CEO of Primary Intelligence, puts it:",GOPPROF-05
"Just like developers shouldn’t be congratulating themselves on how many lines of code they wrote or bugs they fixed, the true measure of your worth is what’s happening outside of your office.",GOPPROF-05
"Focus is critical when it comes to your product, which is why you need to identify what KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and product metrics are most important in order to chase the right ones. Your key metrics should act as a set of product vital signs that provide insight that’s not only useful to you as a product manager but also to stakeholders and other folks within your organization. The specific metrics you monitor within your team (and/or with your engineers) will likely vary from those your stakeholders care about individually, though as a whole should act as levers to what you’re tracking across your organization.",GOPPROF-05
"With the rise of SaaS and all the changes it brought into our lives, product performance metrics have become somehow wider in range and categorization.",GOPPROF-05
"To be a successful modern product leader with a successful product at hand has also become quite a challenge. But as long as you manage to understand how users engage with, and derive value from your product, in other words, reach their aha moments and get to the point where they make the most of your product, it’s not very likely for you to experience such hardship.",GOPPROF-05
"And this is exactly why you, as a product manager, need to collect information about your product performance, its features, market adoption, and more. The correct product metrics will provide you and your product development team with great insights into the overall health of your product, its strong suits, weaknesses, and potential problems and allow you to create space for better improvement and customer experiences.",GOPPROF-05
"These specific product metrics can vary widely between different industries and business types. However, a commonly used set of them is helpful enough to provide a great product experience. Today, I’ll talk about them and provide information on their calculation and use cases.",GOPPROF-05
Let’s begin with a simple definition and then get to know them right away.,GOPPROF-05
"Product Metrics are measurements of data that every business uses to evaluate the overall success of a product and to understand and track how and how often clients are engaging with it. They are like a close-up camera that captures the ways customers, users, or visitors interact with your application, product, or services and shows how those communication channels impact your business.",GOPPROF-05
"They are used by many teams, including marketing, customer success, analytics, and product, to gain further insight into the overall creation journey that begins with plans and hopefully ends in product success. ",GOPPROF-05
"In my list below, I have categorized 10 product development metrics under two titles: Engagement metrics and Economic metrics. But before moving on to them, you need to have a clear idea about the importance of their roles and how much they can achieve for you concerning your product.",GOPPROF-05
Let’s find out more about them.,GOPPROF-05
"Would you be interested in knowing how much of an impact your product has on your customers? Or would you be interested in having a brilliant comprehension of customer behavior? Or, would you be interested in developing a solid strategy for your digital products?",GOPPROF-05
"If the answer is yes, it’s the moment you know that you need some key metrics to track.",GOPPROF-05
Let me elaborate on that.,GOPPROF-05
"Depending on business fields or their product goal, companies may use product metrics to:",GOPPROF-05
and more. ,GOPPROF-05
"To find answers to all of these questions above, you need product metrics. Not only that, you need the relevant ones. ",GOPPROF-05
"Having said that, let’s now take a closer look at the most common product metrics, how to calculate them, and why exactly your business might need them to improve the overall user experience.",GOPPROF-05
Conversion rate is the percentage of visitors visiting your website and showing a sign of desired key actions. These actions often include:,GOPPROF-05
Use Cases,GOPPROF-05
The conversion rate tells you how well your website attracts people and gets them to complete actions similar to the ones mentioned above. ,GOPPROF-05
"This metric is important because if you can increase it, you’ll be able to get leads with minimal effort.",GOPPROF-05
Calculation,GOPPROF-05
"To calculate the conversion rate for whatever your desired action, you take the number of customers who have completed that action and divide that by the number of ‘visitors’ who have not taken the further step and done the same thing yet.",GOPPROF-05
New customer growth rate refers to the speed at which you achieve to gain new clients over a specified period of time. This metric is generally measured within a monthly period; this is why it is sometimes called ”month over month growth”.,GOPPROF-05
"This metric will allow you to understand how good you’re at attracting new customers when calculated and utilized correctly. It’s also great for understanding the overall demand for your product within different times – even the tricky ones, including seasonal demand shifts.",GOPPROF-05
"For this metric to work efficiently, you need to calculate it every month. In that case, the calculation is something like this:",GOPPROF-05
"Customer churn rate is the percentage of users that your company loses over a certain time period. So, depending on your product and business model knowing your churn rate can help you figure out why clients are leaving your services so that you can develop a better plan focusing on customer retention to reduce that number as soon as possible.",GOPPROF-05
Calculation,GOPPROF-05
"Put in other words, let’s say your business had 250 customers at the beginning of the month and lost 10 customers by the end, this means you need to divide 10 by 250. In that case, your churn would be 0.04%.",GOPPROF-05
Cost per acquisition (CPA) is a marketing metric that tells you the total cost of a user completing a specific action.,GOPPROF-05
"In other words, your CPA shows you how much it costs to get each customer active, up, and running from the first touch point to conversion. ",GOPPROF-05
"Depending on your marketing goals, that specific action can be defined as a single click, a purchase, a lead, or something else done by your potential customers.",GOPPROF-05
You need to divide the total cost of your channel/campaign by the number of clients acquired with the help of that same channel/campaign. ,GOPPROF-05
The formula for it is this:,GOPPROF-05
CPA = Campaign Cost / Conversions,GOPPROF-05
"To give an example of this formula in action, let’s say the sales team came up with a campaign that cost you $10,000, and ultimately you drove 1,000 conversions thanks to the same campaign. Then by doing the math; 10,000 / 1,000, your CPA would turn out to be $10.",GOPPROF-05
"Customer Lifetime Value measures how much profit your customers will bring during their relationship with your business. It also shows how well your current user base is doing right now and how likely your business will grow in the future. This metric can be used by your sales/marketing team to make decisions about sales, marketing analytics, product development, retention strategies, and even customer support. ",GOPPROF-05
It can also be used for:,GOPPROF-05
Calculation,GOPPROF-05
"This equation suggests that the CLV equals profit per year multiplied by the average duration of the relationship. And, to know the average duration of the relationship, here’s what you should do. ",GOPPROF-05
"You have to divide the number of your clients by the sum of the years you have been interacting with them. Let’s say you have 5 customers and the sum of the duration of your relationship with them is 20 years. In this case, the average duration of this collaboration would be 20/5: 4.",GOPPROF-05
"This metric measures long-term user satisfaction and the percentage of your loyal clients. It helps you see what matters most before taking big product decisions. It’s mostly great for understanding user actions, user behaviors, customer loyalty and engagement, and the possibility of them recommending your service to others.",GOPPROF-05
Calculation,GOPPROF-05
The way to measure NPS begins with a simple question: ”How likely are you to talk about us to a friend or a co-worker?” ,GOPPROF-05
"Later on, the respondent ranks their likelihood on a scale of 0 to 10, with zero being highly unlikely and ten being extremely likely. It would also help further if you created a comment section in which active users can explain the reasons behind their ratings, making you understand more in detail.  ",GOPPROF-05
"This metric lets you know how well your service works and how much of a user attraction you manage to get via your product. If your active trial number is growing on a regular basis, it means what you are doing is actually working, and people are becoming more engaged and happy with it. By tracking this metric, you will be able to spot trends in your revenue growth, and closely examine the parts that require changes.",GOPPROF-05
"The calculation for active trials is quite simple. One example could be a music streaming app. Let’s say that a specific app offers a one-month free trial before charging a monthly rate for their service, and thus, has 100 subscribers as free trial accounts. In that case, the number they have would be 100 for that month.",GOPPROF-05
The session length metric refers to the amount of time a user spends on your website or application during a single session. ,GOPPROF-05
"This metric is a great way to measure engagement. With its help, you will have clear information about a user leaving right away while interacting with your app or spending quite some time with it. This data can be combined with other indicators to gather valuable information about the value your service provides to the users. ",GOPPROF-05
"To calculate the session length, you need to closely track exactly when a user starts and stops using your product. This can be determined by tracking the first event when the page loads and the last event which can be clicking on a ”Quit” button.",GOPPROF-05
The formula for it is:Timestamp when the user left the app – Timestamp when the user started the app,GOPPROF-05
"Similarly, a specific session refers to the number of times a user pays a visit to your website. This means a single user might have multiple sessions while browsing if they wish to visit at different times or on different days. ",GOPPROF-05
"Sessions per user, at its core, is the number of sessions of a unique user. It’s a set of interactions, visits, and web requests, made within a given time. A single session generally contains multiple crucial activities such as page views, events, or transactions. Therefore, these sessions can help you determine how often your users are actively taking part in actions and interacting with your website. ",GOPPROF-05
"With the help of it, you can understand if your digital marketing is progressively bringing more people to the website or not, or if growth in sessions and page visits are actually a cause of the same users regularly coming back.",GOPPROF-05
"Similar to the session length, your session number is calculated in a very basic way. Let’s say you’re enjoying an end-of-year sale and seeing a spike in interest, resulting in your website having 6,000 sessions in one week and 3,500 in the next. This means your website’s session count for those two weeks is 9,500.",GOPPROF-05
Feature usage is a metric that provides insight into the percentage of customers using different product features. ,GOPPROF-05
"This measurement helps you prioritize the features that actually matter, and remove the focus on others that do not require it as much. ",GOPPROF-05
"With this metric, you’ll gain answers to the most crucial questions like ‘how often is a feature used?’ or ‘how long are users spending on it?’, and more. ",GOPPROF-05
"To calculate the active usage of a product for a specific time frame, you need to divide the number of users using a feature by the total number of users.",GOPPROF-05
The most important key metrics for measuring the performance of a product are as follows:,GOPPROF-05
"To identify product metrics, you first need to decide what you’re looking for. You need to define your business goals and find the right business metrics by asking the right questions first. ",GOPPROF-05
There are certain metrics that will help you evaluate your product performance. These metrics include:,GOPPROF-05

            Product metrics are key metrics (or performance indicators) that help businesses and organisations understand several things. Find out which metrics you should measure!          ",GOPPROF-05
"From understanding the popularity of a product to the quality of service delivered, success metrics can help any organisation understand the path they’re on and, more importantly, where it’s leading them. Defining what constitutes success or failure is a key part of business.",GOPPROF-05
"Every organisation has standards by which they measure product performance, whether that’s revenue generated, customer lifetime value, customer acquisition costs (CAC), retention rate, net promoter score or otherwise.",GOPPROF-05
"But while we’re all no doubt familiar with some (or perhaps all) of these metrics, what do they mean and what do you need to know?",GOPPROF-05
"In this guide, we’ll look at the issue of product metrics as they relate to business and how to use them to understand success and failure. Furthermore, we’ll provide valuable information on how executives can utilise the information here to support future product planning.",GOPPROF-05
Check out our ultimate guide to product development,GOPPROF-05
Product metrics are key metrics (or performance indicators) that help businesses and organisations understand several things:,GOPPROF-05
And much more.,GOPPROF-05
"Now, these metrics are essential for product teams and product managers as they provide insight into the pros and cons of different products after launch, and a roadmap for improvements over time.",GOPPROF-05
"Furthermore, as well as providing a product team with insights for individual product performance, they can also — depending on the overall goals — provide critical business insights when it comes to key decisions or forecasts.",GOPPROF-05
"For example, they can help guide product changes or updates, measure the success of new product features, segment audiences, and forecast revenue. Let’s say based on your product performance metrics, you’ve discovered a specific customer segment demonstrates a higher propensity to buy. From there, you can alter your marketing and sales strategy to develop several tiers for your offerings, enabling customers to choose the options that best suit their needs without alienating any of your existing segments.",GOPPROF-05
"Here’s another instance — let’s say you’ve looked at your product metrics and identified that CSAT scores are significantly higher when new features are added to your products and services. This considered, you can develop a product update schedule and share a public version with your customers. This’ll not only keep them engaged and interested, it’ll also increase their likelihood to purchase.",GOPPROF-05
"Without collecting and analysing product metrics, businesses would have no way of making informed decisions about product development, marketing and sales strategy, or customer engagement.",GOPPROF-05
"However, while product metrics provide a great overview of how the average customer interacts with or uses a product or service, they’re not limited to just product development.",GOPPROF-05
"By looking at the right metrics, you can build a holistic view of user behaviour, the customer journey and more.",GOPPROF-05
"Firstly, there’s a considerable difference between product metrics and wider business metrics.",GOPPROF-05
"Product metrics provide objective data on how users interact with products and their opinions on them. For example, the number of active users, engagement metrics (such as adoption rate), retention, churn, feature usage.",GOPPROF-05
A SaaS company could use product metrics to understand how a feature update improves (or hampers) the customer experience.,GOPPROF-05
"Business metrics, on the other hand, provide a wider picture of the overall business success. For example, overall revenue and profits and cash forecasts.",GOPPROF-05
"That said, you can use product metrics as a precursor to predict business outcomes, product success and new opportunities.",GOPPROF-05
Let’s look at the different types of product metrics and how they can be used to judge both product and business success.,GOPPROF-05
Customer lifetime value allows you to work out how much money a customer will generate in the long term.,GOPPROF-05
Calculating a customer’s lifetime value is simple: you simply take the average order value and multiply it by the frequency of purchase and average customer lifespan.,GOPPROF-05
"For example, one of your customers might purchase $100,000 worth of goods annually and stay with you for 5 years. Their lifetime value is $500,000.",GOPPROF-05
"You can also use customer lifetime value to guide marketing teams on the types of leads and prospects they should target, e.g. targeting lookalike customers — prospects similar to your longest lifetime value customers. This approach enables you to net customers who are most likely to spend and stay with you for a long period.",GOPPROF-05
"Finally, customer lifetime value is incredibly useful when you want to understand how much you should spend on customer acquisition. You can compare average customer lifetime value against the cost of acquiring a new customer. Let’s look at that next.",GOPPROF-05
Calculate your customer lifetime value with our free calculator,GOPPROF-05
Customer acquisition cost (CAC) represents the average spend your company incurs to win new customers.,GOPPROF-05
"Again, this is easy to calculate: take the total cost of marketing and sales and divide it by the number of new users who become customers.",GOPPROF-05
"So if you spend $100,000 and gain 10 new customers, your cost of acquisition is $10,000.",GOPPROF-05
"It’s also useful when it comes to identifying your target audience and whether your marketing and sales activities are focusing on the right topics. For example, you might find that it costs you significantly less to acquire your ideal ‘target’ customer compared to others. On the other hand, you might find new target markets or segments that you hadn’t considered before.",GOPPROF-05
Your monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is the predictable total revenue generated by your business every month.,GOPPROF-05
Understanding MRR is key when it comes to financial forecasting and planning investments in your business. Why? Because it can provide valuable insight into your company’s financial health and stability and also help to identify trends in sales throughout the year.,GOPPROF-05
"For example, if you run a retail store, you might find that your MMR is significantly higher during holiday periods or seasonal sales compared to other months as you attract more customers.",GOPPROF-05
"To calculate MMR, take the total number of customers you have, and multiply that by the amount each customer pays monthly.",GOPPROF-05
"For example, if you have 10 subscription customers paying $10,000 a month to use your software, your MRR is $100,000.",GOPPROF-05
Find out how to create a successful product launch that drives sales,GOPPROF-05
Let’s move on to product engagement metrics.,GOPPROF-05
"Product engagement metrics are used to judge how customers are using your products (whether you’re providing an application, a website, a bit of software or otherwise) and in what numbers.",GOPPROF-05
They typically include:,GOPPROF-05
This metric measures the number of users your product has daily.,GOPPROF-05
"An ‘active user’ is anyone who views or opens the product daily. On its own, however, it’s considered a vanity metric — but understanding daily active users can help you uncover usage trends and measure the immediate impact of new product features (or the removal of old ones).",GOPPROF-05
This metric measures the number of active users your product has over a monthly period.,GOPPROF-05
"Monthly users can be a good metric for judging the overall health of your business, for example, people logging into your app, website, downloading your software, viewing a post or completing a specific event.",GOPPROF-05
Session duration can be used to judge the usability and popularity of a product based on how long a customer uses it once they start to engage with it.,GOPPROF-05
"The longer a customer uses the product, the more successful it is.",GOPPROF-05
"Tracking which features are used, how frequently and who is using them can give your team much-needed insight into your best features and customers.",GOPPROF-05
"For example, if there’s a feature that’s rarely used, that may indicate that it’s not valuable to customers and that you should consider sunsetting it. It can also indicate that a feature is too complex to use or difficult to access. Whatever it is, it’s worth investigating to find out why.",GOPPROF-05
Features that are routinely used are valuable and you should try to invest more in the most successful elements of your products.,GOPPROF-05
"Finally, who is using these features? If a feature finds minimal use but is being used by your highest-paying customers, perhaps it’s time to set up a product tiering system to market that feature more effectively.",GOPPROF-05
Have you come up with a great product? Test your concepts before going to market!,GOPPROF-05
This is a good metric to understand how many times a user comes back and uses your product over a particular period.,GOPPROF-05
"For example, three sessions per user over a week.",GOPPROF-05
"Goal completions are particularly useful for marketing teams as it helps to judge the success of a marketing campaign. For example, downloading a particular piece of content or the number of sales inquiries.",GOPPROF-05
"Ultimately, analysing goal completions helps you to see how many users are doing what you want them to do, and how you can increase that number.",GOPPROF-05
Customer retention rates are useful as a general guide for the overall success or popularity of your product or service.,GOPPROF-05
High retention rates are a good barometer that customers are satisfied with your product or service.,GOPPROF-05
"You should look at retention rates over a daily, weekly and monthly period to ascertain when users are leaving your product. From there, you can devise a strategy to improve the experience at every touchpoint.",GOPPROF-05
"On the other hand, customer or revenue churn is an indication that customers may not be happy using your products or services.",GOPPROF-05
"This is a particularly useful metric when it comes to future planning, particularly when looking at overall product or feature usage, and it can help you understand whether the decisions you’re taking are popular with customers or not.",GOPPROF-05
"Finally, you have product metrics that can help you understand the opinions of customers and how satisfied they are with your products and services or whether you need to make changes.",GOPPROF-05
These customer-oriented metrics are key to help guide any product changes you might need to make based on real customer feedback:,GOPPROF-05
A net promoter score (NPS) is one of the more key performance indicators that can be used to measure customer loyalty with regards to your products and services.,GOPPROF-05
NPS is calculated using quantitative or qualitative results of surveys from your active users to help understand their opinions of your product and service quality.,GOPPROF-05
You can also use these metrics to be more specific on feature updates to understand how your product development is impacting customer loyalty.,GOPPROF-05
"CSAT shows you a user’s overall content or discontent with your product. You ask them to rank your product on a scale, e.g 1-3, 1-5, 1-10, etc., and then you take a sum of the scores divided by the total number of respondents.",GOPPROF-05
"CSAT is different from NPS — while NPS measures overall satisfaction, CSAT measures a user’s satisfaction with a specific feature inside your product.",GOPPROF-05
Improve your customer satisfaction score with our ultimate guide,GOPPROF-05
"A product metric framework should align with your business objectives and product development process. In doing so, you ensure you’re constantly looking to satisfy your customers while sticking to your business’ key philosophies.",GOPPROF-05
A product metric framework typically contains three elements:,GOPPROF-05
Find out more about product research,GOPPROF-05
"Your company’s mission statement is used to define your purpose and beliefs. You then circulate it with customers so they know what you stand for. Finally, your mission statement should guide your product strategy.",GOPPROF-05
"For example, Tesla’s mission statement is to: “Accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.” To that end, Tesla creates innovative energy-efficient vehicles, storage systems, battery packs and other solutions to support the transition to sustainable energy.",GOPPROF-05
"LinkedIn’s mission statement is: “To connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful.” To that end, LinkedIn constantly updates its platform to provide tools for professionals to connect with others, showcase their work, share ideas, liaise with recruiters and much, much more.",GOPPROF-05
"They’re even building learning and development programs into their product with LinkedIn learning, not only helping users to get the most out of the product, but also improve their business skills in the process.",GOPPROF-05
"Your mission statement aligns your product strategy — sure, but it’s also your leading indicator or North Star.",GOPPROF-05
"Of all the metrics you’ll use to judge the success of your product or service, the North Star is the most pivotal as it’s the one you work towards.",GOPPROF-05
"Using LinkedIn as an example, their mission statement is to: “Connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful.” ",GOPPROF-05
"Their leading metric, therefore, is whether customers find LinkedIn makes it easier for them to network, learn and increase their productivity. As such, LinkedIn product managers will constantly review net promoter scores, engagement rates, feature usage and customer behaviour when using LinkedIn to judge the success of their product development.",GOPPROF-05
Driver metrics are the additional product and business metrics you’ll use to ensure everything you do is for the sake of your North Star.,GOPPROF-05
"Choosing the right metrics here is important as they ensure you’re focusing on the right things — those that enhance the customer experience, achieve your business goals and help grow your operations.",GOPPROF-05
"For example, if your mission is to deliver an exceptional customer experience at every touchpoint, what metrics or activities contribute to that? What are your key drivers for your mission? You might look at customer satisfaction scores, overall engagement, customer acquisitions, number of tickets closed and so on.",GOPPROF-05
Collecting product metrics is important but they’ll only get you so far without the right software and analysis to help you make sense of them.,GOPPROF-05
"And with the right strategy and technology, you can identify the key drivers, metrics and even product features that contribute to customer relationship health, positive sentiment and long-term business success.",GOPPROF-05

"Let’s make a bold assumption: Every software product you regularly use is data-driven. Example? Uber, Spotify, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, the AltexSoft website you’re viewing right now – just to name a few. To deliver the most value, encourage your return and loyalty, executives of companies like to start their weeks by looking at metrics – pieces of quantifiable data that illustrate the changes in revenue and customer behavior.",GOPPROF-05
"Of course, knowing these changes exist won’t solve anything. Netflix’s ex VP/CPO Gibson Biddle, explained that they used data to hypothesize and then A/B test assumptions to find out what worked. That’s exactly how Netflix decided to replace their 5-star rating system with simple like and dislike buttons, introduce the “percentage match” of the movies, and majorly simplified the UI.",GOPPROF-05
"In this article, we will introduce you to metrics and KPIs to track your product success. While they will give you the knowledge, the real power lies in how you learn from them, how you interpret, hypothesize, and spark change.",GOPPROF-05
"If you’re new to product management, you may spend some time with our YouTube video to learn more about this practice and then get back to the article:",GOPPROF-05
"Metrics is a quantifiable measure that allow businesses to define and track the success of a product or a business activity. Metrics are used by stakeholders, marketers, and the product management team to detect problems, set goals, and make informed decisions. These problems can relate both to engineering efforts that we covered in the article on Agile development metrics and to the results of the final product.",GOPPROF-05
" Today, the biggest issue with metrics is not how to measure them – Google Analytics alone is a valuable tool for calculating and visualizing your success. It’s choosing a few key metrics to keep an eye on, spend less time tracking, and more time acting upon the found data.",GOPPROF-05
" Depending on what your objective is – attracting a new customer segment, improving popularity with users, getting ideas for new features – you need to choose the right metrics. KPIs are among key points in building a product roadmap – they allow product managers to evaluate engagement, feature usage, user experience, and, of course, commercial success.",GOPPROF-05
Key Product KPIs,GOPPROF-05
"First of all, pay attention to KPIs that contribute to your goals. Check also our video on product metrics:",GOPPROF-05
Product management metrics explained in 12 minutes,GOPPROF-05
Let’s start with the most significant area and learn how to measure revenue.,GOPPROF-05
"Let’s face it: Stakeholders care the most about financial metrics. And rightfully so. These are the numbers showing how much you’re making today and will be making in the future, and subsequently – how much more you can develop or simply for how long you can stay afloat. Stakeholders care about the revenue, customer acquisition cost (CAC) and customer lifetime value (LTV or CLTV). These indicators define the fate of the company and the product.",GOPPROF-05
"These metrics measure a product’s total revenue in one month. To calculate them, consider the MRR at the beginning of the month, add gained revenue from new subscriptions, and subtract churned revenue from lost customers.",GOPPROF-05
,GOPPROF-05
"MRR calculation
Source: ProfitWell",GOPPROF-05
"Average revenue per user (ARPU) allows you to count the revenue generated per user monthly or annually. You need these metrics to define the future service revenue, in case you’re going to change the pricing plan or roll out a promotion.",GOPPROF-05
There are two types of ARPU: per new account and per existing account. ARPU per new account refers to metrics based on new accounts appearing after the subscription plan or product price was changed. ARPU per existing account involves the data from accounts established before the price change. This is the ARPU formula:,GOPPROF-05
Monthly recurring revenue / total number of accounts = ARPU,GOPPROF-05
"Use ARPU to compare yourself to competitors, consider different acquisition channels, or segment which tier of customers brings more value.",GOPPROF-05
"How to use MRR and ARPU. It’s an effective KPI to use to monitor a company’s current health and it’s especially valuable in SaaS businesses working on a subscription basis. Since you don’t need to worry about one-off sales after acquiring a recurring customer, MRR is easily calculated and predictable.",GOPPROF-05
"These metrics allow you to calculate how much money a user will generate in the long term. LTV displays an average profit from one user before they cancel a subscription. The point of this KPI is to show you how much you can spend to attract a new customer at an early stage, regarding the probable profit from one person. To calculate it, establish an average duration of a customer lifetime (how long a customer uses a product before stopping) and average revenue per user.",GOPPROF-05
Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) * Average customer lifetime = CLTV ,GOPPROF-05
"How to use CLTV. Track this metric to test and select customer acquisition channels, purchasing cycles, and retention strategies.",GOPPROF-05
"This metric covers all the costs spent on attracting customers: marketing spendings, sales team work, advertising. Sometimes these costs include salaries of marketing and sales professionals. Usually, customer acquisition cost involves setting a specific period of time and total revenue. There are several formulas to calculate CAC, but the simplest one is:",GOPPROF-05
Sales & marketing spendings for a period of time / total # of customers generated for a period of time = CAC,GOPPROF-05
"How to use CAC. Use CLTV and CAC together to identify whether customers bring you less profit than what you spend on them, and whether it’s time to reconsider pricing and product marketing strategy to attract more users.",GOPPROF-05
"Albeit less relevant to stakeholders, customer-oriented metrics will show you how your product development efforts transform into user interactions. How many users find and use your product? How much time do they spend using it overall or a particular feature? How do customers react to a specifically planted action or feature? Also, these metrics include data on those who stopped using a product abruptly (bounce rates).",GOPPROF-05
"Besides revenue, the most valuable metrics of product growth is the number of users or subscribers for a fixed period of time. But the number of people who have subscribed or purchased your product isn’t a primary KPI. What really matters is the number of active users. Metrics of this category track how many unique visitors or users you have per day (DAU), week (WAU), or month (MAU). A unique visitor is one who visits a website at least once within a given period of time.",GOPPROF-05
Daily Active User (DAU) – the number of active users per day. An “active user” is one who signed in an account and performed some valuable activities.,GOPPROF-05
Monthly Active User (MAU) – the number of active users who complete valuable activities per month.,GOPPROF-05
"This KPI is applied to mobile apps, online games, websites, and social networks. A unique user is defined by ID and login. In identifying the “stickiness” of a product, apply DAU/MAU ratio.",GOPPROF-05
DAU/MAU = # of Daily active users / # of Monthly active users,GOPPROF-05
,GOPPROF-05
"An example of DAU/MAU ratio
Source: Geckoboard",GOPPROF-05
"How to use DAU/MAU ratio. DAU/MAU of 20 percent is considered a good sign, while 50+ percent indicates extreme success. Growing DAU/MAU percentage allows for tracking growth or decline of a product. This ratio is used in forecasting, budgeting, or making a decision to develop new features. However, not every product must be used daily to be considered successful. You can use Uber once a week on a Friday night out or log into Airbnb twice a year. So, high-recency products are more prone to going viral.",GOPPROF-05
"This KPI is the easiest way to track digital product usage. The best way to measure it is to take the total time users spend in your product, divide it by a number of users, and take the mean value. Google Analytics calculates this number for you.",GOPPROF-05
"How to use the session duration metric. If you calculate the session duration of a group of bounced or churned users, you may find a clue on how to improve user interaction and understand what made them stop using a product.",GOPPROF-05
"This KPI mostly applies to websites, while for applications and software we use the number of users. It shows the general number of people who found and visited the website. While organic traffic is related to the number of visitors who found a webpage via search, paid traffic counts those who visited it from paid sources, for example, paid search, social media ads, or sponsored content.",GOPPROF-05
How to use traffic metric. Paid traffic allows you to find out whether you should continue the promotion and how correct your targeting is. Traffic metrics also allows the product manager to understand which type of marketing is more effective.,GOPPROF-05
Another metric is the bounce rate. It allows for measuring the percentage of users who visited only one page of a website or app and left.,GOPPROF-05
"
Bounce rate in Google Analytics
Source: Neil Patel",GOPPROF-05
How to use bounce rate. Bounce rate allows you to track the user behavior and understand how to optimize your product to reduce this number and increase user attention. The next section focuses on more KPIs for attracting the users.,GOPPROF-05
"Retention metrics help understand whether your marketing and customer support efforts pay off. If you know your Customer Acquisition Cost, you know how much it takes to attract a new user. Your current clients are much more likely to try a new feature, switch to a better plan, or take part in an interview for user research, so it makes sense to focus on retaining them.",GOPPROF-05
Customer retention rate (CRR) is the percentage of customers who stayed with the company after a certain time period. You can base your calculations on a number of downloads or first logins to the app.,GOPPROF-05
Retention rate = Customers at the end of the calculated period – New customers / Customers at the start of the calculated period x 100,GOPPROF-05
"How to use retention rate: Based on this KPI, you can understand if and for how long you’ll be able to retain new customers when your customer retention rate is growing. In case it dropped, you can be on the lookout for a new competitor or a problem in customer service. According to the Product Benchmarks Report by Mixpanel, the average CRR for most software products is below 20 percent over 8 weeks, depending on the industry. ",GOPPROF-05
"People are as likely to abandon SaaS apps as they are to bail on a media & entertainment ones after a week
Source: Product Benchmarks Report by Mixpanel",GOPPROF-05
You decide what type of incoming data to use for CRR calculations: what action is considered returning and over what time period you should measure retention.,GOPPROF-05
"While retention rate measures the percentage of users who stayed, the churn rate measures those you’ve lost. There are two types of churn rate: customer churn (number of users who canceled paid subscriptions) and revenue churn (amount of revenue lost due to customer churn). To measure customer churn rate, take the number of customers lost during a certain time period and divide it by the number of customers at the beginning of this time period.",GOPPROF-05
Customer churn rate = Customers lost / Total customers,GOPPROF-05
,GOPPROF-05
"Average churn rate for subscription businesses
Source: Recurly Research",GOPPROF-05
"How to use churn rate. In terms of business success, it’s more effective to pay attention to revenue churn than to customer churn. However, customer churn rate can tell you a lot about customer satisfaction. If you measure churn rate after introducing a new subscription plan or applying a new feature, you can understand whether they were justified or not.",GOPPROF-05
There also are KPIs that allows you to measure the popularity of new and old features and we will discuss them now.,GOPPROF-05
"One of the central product manager responsibilities is to lead the product development workshop, where a product team works on ideation of new features and UX design. To make relevant decisions, you need convincing data on product and feature usage. Two key metrics here are the number of user actions and sessions per user.",GOPPROF-05
"This metric helps understand key user behavior: how often users come back and use the site. It can be tracked with statistics that display the number of logins or site visits. This KPI reveals the popularity of a product – if the audience engages with it again and again. Unlike traffic or session duration, the number of sessions per user shows an average for a particular group of people in some time period.",GOPPROF-05
How to use number of sessions per user. Compare this data within different groups of users or visitors (retained and churned) to forecast user behavior changes before churn and prevent it.,GOPPROF-05
"This KPI seems similar to the previous one, but it tracks not just how many times a user opened an app. It displays which actions a user made and which feature(s) they used while using the app. This metric is used to understand the popularity of a certain feature since it was introduced and compared to a particular period of time. Also, you can compare these metrics of churned and retained customers and get an idea of what makes the users interested in your product.",GOPPROF-05
"How to use number of user actions. Use this data in A/B testing to make decisions about features, UX elements, and to understand customer behavior.",GOPPROF-05
The last metric to consider is the level of customer satisfaction and the following section is devoted to key indicators that allow you to track it.,GOPPROF-05
"Churn and bounce rates, traffic, and retention rate tell about customer perception of your service or product indirectly. The primary way to learn if the customers are happy is direct customer feedback. Net promoter score, customer satisfaction score, and customer effort are metrics that can be obtained via surveys.",GOPPROF-05
"This metric measures the number of loyal customers who are likely to recommend a product (promoters), and those customers who hate it (detractors). To calculate NPS, ask users to rank your product from 0 to 10. Detractors would give it from 0 to 6 points, users with 7-8 points are neutrals, and those who gave it 9-10 are promoters. The NPS formula is:",GOPPROF-05
NPS = % of promoters – % of detractors,GOPPROF-05
,GOPPROF-05
"An example of NPS
Source: Datapine",GOPPROF-05
Bain and Company who initially introduced the metric identified that high NPS leads to 20-60 percent of organic growth. Same goes for negative NPS – a high number of detractors results in economic penalties.,GOPPROF-05
"How to use NPS. NPS awareness throughout the organization motivates employees to deliver more value, react to issues faster, and get to the root of detractors’ problems. Besides, any information learned about detractors should be shared among all departments in a common effort to improve the overall experience of your customers.",GOPPROF-05
"It measures the overall level of content or discontent of a user about a specific product or service feature. Usually, users are asked to rank a product or service on a scale of 1-3, 1-5, or 1-10. It’s calculated by summing the score and dividing it by the number of respondents. Unlike NPS, CSAT is directed towards evaluating satisfaction with a particular feature. Customer experience is measured with other metrics: Customer Effort Score (CES). Measured like the CSAT, you need a customer survey where users rank how easy it was to find a necessary information about a product.",GOPPROF-05
"How to use the CSAT. Ask for user feedback at several points through the customer journey and do it before another subscription renewal so you have time to introduce improvements. Also, use this metric as an industry benchmark – the American Customer Satisfaction Index logs data from the biggest companies and compares stats with past results.",GOPPROF-05
"According to State of Product Leadership 2019 survey by Pendo and Product Collective, the majority of product managers still focus on product features and feature delivery. Product goals remain their primary concern, while adoption, revenue, and user retention remain a secondary or even tertiary concern. Does it mean that product managers should keep measuring their success the same way? The survey shows that it’s not a very favorable strategy for a lucrative product: the less you focus on customers, the less successful your product becomes compared to your competitors. Here are several recommendations:",GOPPROF-05
"Keep in mind that a product is not just about the software itself, it is about the value and customer satisfaction – so the most important metrics should be concerned with the user.",GOPPROF-05

"For product managers, KPIs are a powerful tool. They quantify team progress, the progress of the product, and the overall business. Product manager KPIs include specific metrics associated with the product, customers, and the overall process in bringing a product to market.
",GOPPROF-05
"For product managers (PDMs), key performance indicators (KPIs) are the strongest, defensible tool in decision making. They identify the progress of the work of the team, the progress of the product and the overall business. Product manager KPIs include specific activities associated with the product, customers, and the overall process for bringing a product to market.",GOPPROF-05
"KPIs should be used to celebrate success and identify risk. Conversely, the lack of KPIs leave a product manager blind to what’s going on and show a weakness in management style. Product managers should determine which product management metrics are the most important to track and report.",GOPPROF-05
,GOPPROF-05
The role of a product manager can be mystifying to many stakeholders. Some view it from their understanding of a project manager—keeping the progress on track and coordinating people to work together. Others view the role as a liaison between the sales teams and the engineering organization—translating business requirements into technical requirements.,GOPPROF-05
"Progressive executive teams recognize product managers as the overall business owner or a business unit manager for a specific set of deliverables—the product. Product managers are responsible for the perception they want for their role. Strong PDMs leverage product management success metrics as a tool to demonstrate their proficiency in managing their product. More importantly, product KPIs are the foundation for monitoring the success or failure of products or the company.",GOPPROF-05
"Product manager KPIs cover a broad set of topics. Product managers that come from an engineering background often focus on creating KPIs associated with the product. For product managers with a marketing background, the response is usually associated with usage or customer behaviors.",GOPPROF-05
"Product managers must make the judgment call identifying what is most useful to assist them in their decision-making and their communications strategy. They should work with the executive team to identify the product management metrics that help them with their decision-making and in support of corporate goals. When pitching new ideas and asking for the investments required, having data about previous trends, and identifying methods of validating investment strategies will create a stronger business case.",GOPPROF-05
,GOPPROF-05
"KPIs can be organized into various categories. It is important for product managers to explore which product management KPIs are important to communicate as part of building credibility, encouraging engagement, celebrating success, or identifying trends and issues.",GOPPROF-05
"Professional PDMs will be selective when creating KPI reports. Depending on the level of automation, KPIs can involve many people. Pick the top five or six that give you the confidence in your progress and in your decision-making.",GOPPROF-05
"The most common set of performance targets are the business KPIs that product managers often overlook. Creating KPIs for business performance will help identify trends in the success of the growth of the business. These are focused around customers, customer lifetime value, bookings, revenues, costs, and profitability. For executives, these business performance metrics will be the ones that drive investment decisions, lay a foundation for additional headcount, or drive go-no-go decisions at the departmental or product level.",GOPPROF-05
"The following table identifies some KPIs relating to business performance, a suggested cadence, and descriptions.",GOPPROF-05
"Product managers should monitor customer related KPIs as an indicator of how well the sales and customer success engagements are working. If customer velocity is reducing, then it’s critical to understand why. Is it a new competitor? Is it a pricing issue? Is it a customer communications/expectation issue? If customers are leaving (churn or attrition) then a deep dive should immediately ensue to explore remediation activities.",GOPPROF-05
"A rapid increase in growth can lead to a discussion about market share, pricing increases, and new investments in the growth of the product line. Rapid growth can impact the performance of your operating environments, especially in a SaaS environment as it relates to COGS and OCOGS. Do you have enough capacity? Is Support sufficiently staffed? Is Customer Success able to handle the volume of customers? Are trends showing that you need to act immediately to prepare for the additional overhead?",GOPPROF-05
,GOPPROF-05
"When considering financial or revenue forecasting and planning, find out about seasonal implications. These might include a need for “use it or lose it” budget situations at the end of the fiscal year. Most companies close their year in December. Consider March break as a down time and summer as a slow-down time for many businesses as people take vacations. Year over year comparisons will show those trends. Plan product releases, launches, and announcements with those considerations in mind.",GOPPROF-05
Product usage KPIs will help to identify how the product is perceived and used. It will help drive roadmap decisions relating to key feature functionality and user experience (UX). Create the tracking mechanisms within your applications to understand behavior as a tool for continuous improvement. Track often and report trending over a period of time.,GOPPROF-05
Utilize the product usage KPIs to identify potential customers that might churn due to performance issues. Monitor these KPIs to address situations before they become escalated issues. A program of continuous improvement will leverage these KPIs to demonstrate success.,GOPPROF-05
"Product development KPIs help with identifying process improvements, velocity, and speed of development. Monitoring and sharing the results from the team can create new energy and competitiveness.",GOPPROF-05
"It’s important to work with the engineering leads to agree on appropriate KPIs and to share them with the team. KPIs can form a basis for recognizing achievements, managing team size, or identifying areas for improvement.",GOPPROF-05
"Product quality KPIs will identify trends and risks in delivering an extraordinary customer experience. Product managers should consider tradeoffs in quality against delivery timelines, keeping in mind that a single failure found by a single client can have a profound impact on the business. As more customers leverage social networking to share their displeasure, quality KPIs should be high on the priority list.",GOPPROF-05
"Product quality can form a validation of the quality of the engineering organization. Properly used, KPIs can create a foundation for continuous improvement, reduction in testing, automation, and overall improved customer experience.",GOPPROF-05
"When building relationships with other organizations within the company, recognize that they also have KPIs. Many of those are shared (e.g., revenues, customers, usage, etc.). For product managers with goals around meeting analysts’ comparisons (e.g., Gartner Magic Quadrant), working with Marketing to promote positive results can support the competitive market positioning needs. The foundation may start with customers that are loving the product (usage is increasing), which improves the brand (a marketing KPI). This could turn into a customer success story, be used with analysts to drive further brand recognition, or can be tied to word-of-mouth qualified lead generation.",GOPPROF-05
"Identification of negative trends can lead to mitigation plans that will remediate the situation as a team. For example, if Finance identifies that renewals revenues are dropping off, Product Management can coordinate with Marketing to create a sales renewals campaign around a new (or upcoming) functionality to address the situation. In this scenario, not only does the renewal (revenue) challenge get resolved, but Product Management can identify potential MVP or beta users to test and promote new functionality.",GOPPROF-05
Understanding how product management KPIs fit with each organization’s goals can create synergies to drive successful relationships. A regular cadence of communications with the rest of the organizations can help with early identification of opportunities to improve. Here are a few discussion topics where other departments may be involved when certain trends are identified.,GOPPROF-05
"As the center point to the overall product business, a product manager has the unique opportunity to influence and drive success for the company with clear communications. Explore the following business scenarios and consider which performance metrics will create the best positive impact when communicated regularly.",GOPPROF-05
"Ambiguity is the bane of any communications. Exactly how bad is it? How great was it? What are the facts? Creating a data-driven foundation helps to eliminate fuzzy conversations and creates definitive, clear communications. An informed product manager will have their finger on the pulse of the business performance, product development, product quality and product usage KPIs that are the foundation of a well functioning business.",GOPPROF-05
"The opportunity for product management teams to drive a business lies in the knowledge, based on real data, of how the key factors of the product and business are running over time. Pick the top five or ten KPIs—monitor them religiously and repeat them at every opportunity.",GOPPROF-05
"By continuously communicating successes and dealing rapidly with negative results, the surprises and challenges that always come with the job of a product manager will be minimized. Knowledge is power, and product management KPIs allow product managers to own success. Skills in getting this right can make or break a company.",GOPPROF-05
"A KPI is a measure of performance. It counts activities, revenues, costs, usage, or other measures that inform decisions. Product managers will use KPI data to monitor success or failure in product or business goals. KPIs can also identify changes which might require an immediate change in business direction. ",GOPPROF-05
"Product managers will choose KPIs that meet specific performance goals or those of the company. This may include customer performance, product usage, product development or financial performance indicators. Product managers will monitor 5-6 KPIs regularly and select others to monitor for specific situations. ",GOPPROF-05
"Popular company performance indicators include revenues, profits, and the number of customers. Measured over time, the speed of growth is important in identifying investment opportunities to further accelerate company success. Conversely, unexpected negative changes should warrant immediate investigation. ",GOPPROF-05
"Important product performance indicators include on-time delivery, quality, support, usability, and customer adoption. With a culture of continuous improvement, most product managers will look for ways to increase revenues, loyalty, and usability to drive an increasing customer lifetime value (CLV). ",GOPPROF-05
The product management role defines taking a concept and turning it into reality. They are responsible for the success of their product(s). The role spans coordinating with every stakeholder in the organization from the client who will purchase or use it to the entire corporate organization.,GOPPROF-05
"The product management process is best viewed from the customer journey. A product manager is responsible for optimizing each touchpoint with a customer or prospect to ensure a positive experience. The success of those touchpoints will drive the success of the product, which in turn defines company success.",GOPPROF-05
"Product management owns the success of the product. Product managers motivate and inspire entire organizations to accomplish the tasks required to get a product to market. They are experienced, professional managers. They are key decision makers; their decisions must be credible and understood by all stakeholders.",GOPPROF-05

"For something so fundamentally important to a company’s success, product development is notoriously tricky to manage. In part, that’s because R&D activities require companies to juggle so many dimensions. They must balance new features and innovative technologies against cost, risk, and time to market. They must consider how well they are meeting the needs of customers with varying requirements. And they must understand how new products will fit into their existing portfolio, and how they stack up against competitor offerings.",GOPPROF-05
"Companies also must ensure they are making the right use of limited resources, allocating people, time, and money to the projects that will best meet their short- and long-term strategic goals. That raises a crucial question: how should they measure the performance of their product-development teams?",GOPPROF-05
"By themselves, metrics aren’t a solution to product-development challenges, but the key performance indicators (KPIs) companies use do show where management is focusing its attention. That led us to wonder about the relationships between what companies track in product development and how they perform.",GOPPROF-05
"To investigate this issue, we conducted a new analysis to compare companies’ use of different product-development KPIs and their overall financial performance. We based the work on ten years of data collected through the McKinsey Product Development Fingerprint, a proprietary product-development diagnostic tool.",GOPPROF-05
"This research is at an early stage. Our dataset comprises 42 companies, for which detailed data on product-development metrics and financial performance was available. Nevertheless, the work reveals a number of intriguing and potentially counterintuitive findings.",GOPPROF-05
"In our analysis, we considered a company to be “using” a metric if it was cited by more than one-third of staff interviewed. That’s important, because widespread knowledge of a metric indicates that the company is using that indicator actively as part of its performance-management processes.",GOPPROF-05
"For almost a decade, the McKinsey Product Development Fingerprint diagnostic has gathered data based on in-depth assessments of companies’ product-development practices and outcomes. The fingerprinting approach has now been applied to more than 500 projects at around 130 organizations. One element of the diagnostic involves structured interviews with staff from all parts of the R&D function, who are asked about the metrics their organization uses to monitor product-development activities.",GOPPROF-05
"For our new analysis, we selected 42 companies from the Fingerprint database, choosing those with both a good dataset on the metrics in use, and publicly available data on financial performance over the ten-year period from 2007 to 2016.",GOPPROF-05
"In our analysis, we considered a company to be “using” a metric if the metric was cited by at least one-third of participants in the diagnostic interview phase. That’s important, because widespread knowledge of a metric indicates that the company is using that indicator actively as part of its performance management processes.",GOPPROF-05
"The Fingerprint survey is retrospective: It asks participants to comment on practices and metrics used in a specific, recently completed project.",GOPPROF-05
"To estimate the correlation between each organization’s KPIs and its overall financial performance, we created a new metric of our own, taking the company’s profit growth for the year after its participation in the Fingerprint and subtracting the average profit growth for companies in its sector. For companies that outperformed their sector, this index of relative-profit growth would be positive, and the better their performance, the higher it would be.",GOPPROF-05
"We also wanted to look at the relationship between product-development metrics and profitability over the longer term. In particular, we wanted to identify the approaches used by companies that achieve consistent high performance. To do this, we designed a second metric. To create our ten-year index of profit-growth stability, we calculated each company’s relative-profit growth for every year between 2007 and 2016, then divided the sum of these values by their standard deviation. The larger and more stable a company’s profit growth over the analysis period, the higher this figure would be.",GOPPROF-05
"To study the impact of individual KPIs on short- and long-term financial performance, we compared the average of each of our two metrics for companies that used a given indicator with the average for those that did not.",GOPPROF-05
"We correlated the use of selected metrics with two measures of financial performance. The first was relative-profit growth, based on profit growth at the company in the year the data was collected, compared to the average for its sector. The second was profit-growth stability, which quantifies the variability of profit growth over a ten-year period, again in comparison to the sector average. For full details of our data set, and how we analyzed it, see sidebar, “Linking product-development metrics to financial performance.”",GOPPROF-05
"More than three-quarters of companies in our sample made widespread use of product volume, revenue, unit cost, and time-to-market KPIs. The majority also have metrics in place to measure the reliability of their manufacturing operations. That puts these “product-related” metrics among the most commonly used across our sample. And, on our short-term measure, companies that use these metrics perform better than the minority that don’t.",GOPPROF-05
"When we looked at profit-growth stability, however, a different picture emerged. Over a ten-year period, the benefits of tracking product-focused metrics disappeared, suggesting a different focus becomes increasingly important as time passes. One possible explanation for this finding is that some organizations are sacrificing long-term performance in the pursuit of short-term objectives, for example by working hard to get the next product into the market without sufficient attention to the development of a broad portfolio, or to the technologies and strategies that will underpin future product generations (Exhibit 1).",GOPPROF-05
,GOPPROF-05
"While the majority of the companies in our sample monitor customers’ satisfaction with product performance, only 44 percent of them measure customers’ satisfaction with the price they paid for the value they received. Our analysis suggests that this is a measure that deserves more attention, since it is strongly correlated with both short-term profit growth and long-term stability. Indeed, the average relative-profit growth of the companies that did use this metric was 12.9 percentage points higher than those that did not (Exhibit 2).",GOPPROF-05
,GOPPROF-05
"Over the long term, two customer-related metrics were associated with profit-growth stability: customer satisfaction with price for value and product performance against its specification.",GOPPROF-05
"This makes intuitive sense, as understanding your customer’s real requirements, delivering on your promises, and offering strong value for money are good ways to build reputation and customer loyalty.",GOPPROF-05
"The use of metrics related to supplier performance was less widespread in our sample. In particular, only one-third of companies measure innovations that were developed by or with their suppliers and partners. The use of this type of metric was strongly associated with both relative-profit growth and profit-growth stability. For example, companies that measure suppliers’ innovation performance show an average short-term profit growth that’s 15.4 percentage points higher than the rest (Exhibit 3).",GOPPROF-05
,GOPPROF-05
"Across industries, innovative ideas and enabling technologies are increasingly likely to come from outside the organization. Companies that measure their effort to identify and exploit external innovation are more likely to get better at it.",GOPPROF-05
"Only 39 percent of the companies in our sample take a systematic approach to measuring project-team morale. This metric delivered an ambiguous result: In the short term, it is associated with poorer relative-profit growth, but over the long term, it is linked with better profit-growth stability.",GOPPROF-05
"That could indicate a trade-off between performance and health. Companies that work their product-development teams harder might squeeze better results from them in the short term, but product development is a marathon, not a sprint. Healthier teams may be better-equipped to regroup and produce good results, project after project, year after year.",GOPPROF-05
"The most intriguing result of our analysis is one that should give every R&D leader pause for thought. The variable with the most significant negative correlation with short-term financial performance was budget adherence. Only 15 percent of the companies in our sample did not make widespread use of this metric, but those companies had an average relative-profit growth 11.4 percentage points higher than the remaining 85 percent. Moreover, budget adherence was also the only metric to show a significant negative correlation with both short-term profit growth and long-term stability (Exhibit 4).",GOPPROF-05
,GOPPROF-05
"This finding should not be interpreted as a suggestion that companies stop tracking their R&D project budgets, but it may have important implications for the way budgets are used. Remember that “use” of a metric by a company indicates that it was cited by more than a third of respondents from that organization. In practice, every company we surveyed was collecting data on budget adherence. In a few of them, however, that fact was not widely known, suggesting that these companies were not using the metric as an active management tool. Our hypothesis here is that freeing R&D teams from excessive pressure to ensure budget compliance enables them to be more flexible, effective, and innovative. Product development is inherently risky and unpredictable: no plan survives contact with the enemy. Freeing teams from strict budgetary limits may lead to product designs that perform better in the market.",GOPPROF-05
"For product-development leaders, our analysis offers some important insights. In the short term, companies looking to accelerate their profit growth are wise to focus on the classic metrics that most already use, such as volumes, revenues, unit costs, time to market and process discipline. Over the long term, however, companies should also measure the things that build customer loyalty, such as satisfaction with a product’s performance, price, and specifications. And they should think about their people, understanding team morale and working to address the issues they find. As partners and suppliers play an ever more important role in product-development and innovation activities, a systematic approach to developing these relationships provides benefits in both the short and long-term.",GOPPROF-05
"Finally, every organization should think hard about the way product-development budgets are used. That doesn’t mean abandoning budgeting altogether, although that approach has worked well for some.

"There’s a shift under way in large organizations, one that puts design much closer to the center of the enterprise. But the shift isn’t about aesthetics. It’s about applying the principles of design to the way people work. Design companies, those that take a human-centric approach, outperform other companies by 200%! It's big business, and it’s not new—it’s a resurgence to understanding human behavior and the needs of our customers.",GOPPROF-02
"This approach, in part, is a response to the increasing complexity of technology and business. That complexity takes many forms. Sometimes software is at the center of a product and needs to be integrated with hardware, and then made intuitive and simple from the user’s point of view. Sometimes the problem being tackled is multi-faceted: Think about how much tougher it is to work with the regulations in health care or finance as opposed to designing a simple product. Sometimes the business environment is so volatile a company must experiment with multiple paths in order to survive.",GOPPROF-02
"I could list a dozen other types of complexity that businesses grapple with every day. But here’s what they all have in common: people need help making sense of them. Specifically, people prefer their interactions with technology, products and services to be simple, intuitive, and pleasurable. No-one wants to need to read a user manual.",GOPPROF-02
"A set of principles collectively known as design thinking—empathy with users, a discipline of prototyping, and tolerance for failure—is the best tool we have for creating those kinds of interactions and developing a responsive, flexible organizational culture.",GOPPROF-02
Let's take a look at three steps to grow your Product Mindset and creating products your customers love. ,GOPPROF-02
"Think about the companies you love, and they are most likely a design company. Apple, Disney, Target are among them. Brand loyalty evokes a feeling inside of us. ",GOPPROF-02
"I live in Florida now and while I’m not necessarily a fan of Disney World, I am a fan of Disney—particularly of how Disney has been taking some risks like buying Marvel or the acquisition of Pixar. Those acquisitions have helped to modernize a 100-year old company. The Disney princesses that my daughter loved are much different than the princesses my granddaughter knows. Think about Elsa from Frozen – she isn’t waiting on her prince to solve things – she is relying on her own strengths and on her sister. They've produced strong storylines with powerful black leads, like Black Panther, which was a huge success in the market - evidence that Disney is paying attention to the messages and culture we want our children to grow up with. ",GOPPROF-02
"Another example of a Design Company is Target, who provided a feature in their app to allow consumers to earn votes for purchases and cast their votes for local charities to receive funds.",GOPPROF-02
We start building brand loyalty by having empathy for our customers. We build empathy with our customers by leaving our seats. Bring customers into your discovery and review processes; let your developers shadow them for a day and talk to users directly. Eliminate buffers like relationship managers or sales reps so people who build the product get really connected with the people with problems.  ,GOPPROF-02
"Value is what your customer is willing to pay for. Value is what your customer is willing to pay for. More and more of the work people do in the world is about creating valuable solutions to complex problems. This means we need to focus more on outcomes than on the outputs. It’s not just about how much stuff we can create; it’s about the value or benefits that stuff provides. We need to clearly define what value means individually, for our team, and for our organization.",GOPPROF-02
"Value is tricky. But Bain & Company has helped us out. They have codified the value proposition to help us understand 30 different elements of consumer value which can help companies gain an edge. https://www.bain.com/insights/the-elements-of-value-hbr/ (Below is a snippet from their output - I encourage you to visit their work to learn more, or look into our Advanced Product Owner courses.)",GOPPROF-02
What Bain and Company has done is to further define the value proposition which has helped us to explore other expressions of value – knowing that we are more willing to buy a product or change our behavior or use a service when it is solving our problems. ,GOPPROF-02
"Functional: Products or services that make somebody money, save time, might reduce risk. We can go on and on—our world is full of these products and services we can’t live without that fulfill our functional needs. ",GOPPROF-02
Emotional: There's a lot of ads for products or services out there that affect us at an emotional level. Consider the Wellness or Therapeutic dimensions: Meditation apps are a big trend right now - how many of us have at least one wellness or meditation app on our phone? ,GOPPROF-02
"Life Changing: Consider the Motivational dimension: The fitness app business is thriving. Take Fitbit for example, and all the ways Fitbit prompts us for more activity or rewards our efforts. The Affiliation dimension describes that sense of kinship we feel by being affiliated with a team or organization. I grew up in Idaho and we didn’t have our own professional football team and so my dad was a huge Dallas Cowboys fan. I loved the Cowboys long before I knew anything about the game of football because of the sense of joy and belonging that I experienced watching the game with my dad. ",GOPPROF-02
"Social Impact: When considering this element, think - what problem(s) are we solving that can help us reach self-actualization, for ourselves, for our product line, for the community? As consumers, we are willing to pay more for a product or a service when they are tied to causes that we care about, such as 40cean. I am an environmentalist so I’m willing to buy a product or support a cause when I know they are giving something back to the environment. I donate money to 40cean to help clean plastic out of the ocean; in return, I receive a simple bracelet made out of string and recycled plastic. Wearing the bracelets garners attention: I get to share the message show you I am putting money towards this cause. Other examples of well known products whose mission ties directly with the product line: Bomba’s Socks, Tom's Shoes, Impossible Foods. ",GOPPROF-02
"Think about the All-In Challenge I wrote about in my previous post. This effort touches many layers in Bain's value pyramid, which I believe can be attributed to the phenomenal success of this digital fundraiser for the hungry. The challenge gives sports and media fans a way to get involved (social impact) when we see neighborhoods, friends or family struggling with hunger; the movement is solving a dire need (hope); and we receive the value of the experience with a sports star or celebrity (affiliation).",GOPPROF-02
"Value is only an assumption until it is validated by the market  Cagan reminds us in his book Inspired that we often overlook innovation that our technologists and engineers can bring to solve problems because they are not included in planning and discovery processes. This is a mistake - who else is so uniquely positioned to know more about the art of the possible? He makes the point that it is more valuable to show your users something working, and get their feedback on it, than to run a focus group. ",GOPPROF-02
"An important part of the process is validating assumptions to test if a product or service will be of value in the market, and yet, it is often overlooked or bypassed. This isn't just testing the feasibility (the how) from a technical perspective, we are talking about testing the feasibility that people will change their behavior to buy our product or use our service. ",GOPPROF-02
"Think of a time when your customer came to you with an idea, and you went to work, and delivered on it. A typical product development approach means starting with the Why (thank you to Simon Sinek and Roman Pichler and all those industry greats who have given us the tools and techniques to dig into purpose.) It's seems to be a common practice now to pause and clarify the vision, and then go forward with building out a product strategy. If you are an agile development shop, perhaps you focused on a time to market goal and feedback loops. Maybe you even planned to test out a minimal viable product with small beta launches before a big public launch. These are all great practices, and all part of building a thing right.",GOPPROF-02
But all of these things are building on a certain level of growing assumptions – each of those outputs require a certain level of effort and investment. And the investment increases and increases – what we’re missing is the discipline to clarify the problem we are solving and validating our assumptions that this thing that we want to provide will solve that problem. To find out if we are building the right thing.,GOPPROF-02
"Cagan describes legendary venture capitalist John Doerr who stated, “We need teams of missionaries, not teams of mercenaries.” This point goes to the heart of the most important trait of strong leaders, strong organizations, and strong product teams.",GOPPROF-02
"Teams of missionaries are engaged, motivated, have a deep understanding of the business context, and tangible empathy for the customer. Teams of mercenaries feel no real sense of empowerment or accountability, no passion for the problem to be solved, and little real connection with the actual users and customers.",GOPPROF-02
 Examples of Validation Techniques,GOPPROF-02
"As missionaries, we want to evangelize the product and validate the need before we invest in development. Validation techniques help us define the product-market fit. We can describe development as the Product fit (can we create a business?) and Discovery as the Problem fit (should we build it?).",GOPPROF-02
"I could describe validation techniques as a whole separate post (check back later!) For the origin of these techniques and examples of their applications, refer to the books Lean Startup by Eric Ries and Lean UX by Jeff Gotshel. Below are just two quick examples from products you probably know. ",GOPPROF-02
"Drew Houston, CEO of Dropbox, put out a 3-minute video that simply explained the product before it was built out completely. This simple, short Explainer Video took them from 5,000 interested customers on their mailing list to 75,000 overnight. This was evidence there was a large market of people looking for the product he wanted to develop.",GOPPROF-02
"Nick Swinmurn tested his assumption that people would buy shoes online before he ever built the site - called Shoesite.com - before building the technology to power the e-commerce giant that it is today, which is now called Zappos. Instead of purchasing a large inventory and hoping that people were interested in buying shoes online, he went to the mall and took pictures of items at local shoe stores. Once he got an order, he went back and bought the shoes and mailed them through the post office. This type of validation is called the Wizard of Oz strategy. ",GOPPROF-02
"Dropbox and Zappos are common name brands now, but they didn't launch through some kind of big platform - it was the 3-step process: Identifying a problem, creating a value proposition, and validating assumptions that helped them understand if they had a product-market fit, all before a heavy investment in development. Then add on a lot of hard work and grit, resilience, and a little bit of luck. ",GOPPROF-02
The point is: Developing any product without discovering the evidence of value is waste.,GOPPROF-02
"Make products that are transformational not transactional, by growing your product mindset. You can’t design an experience – you have to get things into the hands of real users so that you can match user expectations with user behavior. You can use these 4 principles and 3 techniques to grow your Product Mindset, move from ""Are we building the thing right?"" to ""Are we building the right thing?"" and build products your customers love.",GOPPROF-02

Let’s take a look at three steps to grow your Product Mindset and apply it to create products your customers love.,GOPPROF-02
1. Identify the Problem,GOPPROF-02
“Stop thinking about your customers and start thinking like them.” ~Chris Spagnuolo,GOPPROF-02
"Think about the companies you are loyal to, and they are most likely a user-centric company, meaning they are hyper-focused on the user experience. They are organizations that have tapped into how their users feel about their products. Apple, Disney, and Target are among them.",GOPPROF-02
"Brand loyalty evokes a feeling inside of us. Disney fans are good examples of brand loyalty. I live in Florida, surrounded by Disney World fanatics.",GOPPROF-02

"Another example is Target. I know a young couple who like going to Target so much it’s part of their regular date night. Beyond the experience they get in the store, Target has deployed some features that align with their user’s more intrinsic values. Their app has a feature that allows consumers to earn votes for purchases and cast their votes for local charities to receive funds.",GOPPROF-02
"How do we build a product strategy that creates that kind of brand loyalty? We start with the product mindset, and that starts with building empathy for our customers.

Find ways to have developers shadow users and talk to them directly.

3. Validate the Outcome — Value is only an assumption until the market validates it,GOPPROF-02
“We don’t know what’s possible with technology — none of us really know until we actually see it.” ~Marty Cagan,GOPPROF-02
"Value is only an assumption until the market validates it. Cagan reminds us in his book “Inspired” of two important points. First, we often overlook innovation that our technologists and engineers can bring to solve problems. Developers are uniquely positioned to know more about the art of the possible that new technology brings to opportunity. Secondly, he points out that it is more valuable to show your users something and get their feedback than to run a focus group. Both of these complement important elements of Agile frameworks. To have those doing the work involved in planning it and getting frequent feedback from real users.",GOPPROF-02
"Validating assumptions to test if a product or service will be of value in the market is such an important part of the process, and yet, it is often overlooked or bypassed. This isn’t just testing the feasibility (the how) from a technical perspective. It means testing the feasibility of changing their behavior to buy our product or use our service.",GOPPROF-02
"I often see a typical product development approach with clients: Receive a request, define the purpose and vision, and then develop quickly. Time is of the essence. If you are an Agile shop, Time to Market is a common metric to prove success. The agile development pattern suggests defining an MVP (minimal viable product), launching a beta version, and then deploying a big public launch. These are all great practices and all part of building a thing right.",GOPPROF-02
"But all of these steps are adding to a growing mountain of assumptions — each one requires a significant effort, which equals investment. And the investment increases and increases and increases. What is missing is the discipline to clarify the problem and validate assumptions that this product we are providing will solve that problem. In essence, to gather evidence that the team is building the right thing.",GOPPROF-02

"Drew Houston, CEO of Dropbox, produced a 3-minute video demonstrating the ease and value of the product before it was built out completely. This short Explainer Video took Dropbox from 5,000 interested customers on their mailing list to 75,000 overnight. This was evidence there was a large market of people looking for the product he wanted to develop.",GOPPROF-02
"Nick Swinmurn tested his assumption that people would buy shoes online before he ever built the site Zappos (called Shoesite.com then.) Instead of purchasing a large inventory and hoping people would buy shoes online, he went to the mall and took pictures of shoes in shoe stores. Once he got an order, he went back to the mall, bought the shoes, and mailed them through the post office. This type of validation is called the Wizard of Oz strategy.",GOPPROF-02
"Dropbox and Zappos are common name brands now. Still, they didn’t launch through some big platform — it was this 3-step process: Identifying a problem, creating a value proposition, and validating assumptions that helped them understand if they had a product-market fit, all before a heavy investment in development. Then add on a lot of hard work and grit, resilience, and a little bit of luck.",GOPPROF-02
Developing anything without gathering evidence of value is waste.,GOPPROF-02
"Make products that are transformational, not transactional, by growing your product mindset. You can’t sit at your desk and design the perfect product — you have to start thinking like your users. Be willing to change your mind about what seems like a great idea at the table by asking others. Discover their pain points and challenges. Get an imperfect prototype into the hands of real users to validate those assumptions with a wider audience. Then pivot your way through your product development, making decisions based on that validated evidence.",GOPPROF-02
"Use these 3 techniques to grow your Product Mindset, move from “Are we building the thing right?” to “Are we building the right thing?” and build products your customers love.",GOPPROF-02

"This week, Product School hosted Govind Wakhlu, Product Leader at Facebook, for a special #AskMeAnything session. Govind answered questions regarding developing a product mindset, advice for his younger self, and how to deal with complexity both in people and product.",GOPPROF-02
"Govind has 13+ years of experience across Fortune 500 giants, mid-sized companies, and early-stage startups including 11+ years in Product Management, and a stint as a venture-funded founder. ",GOPPROF-02
"Currently, as a Product Leader at Facebook, he is responsible for building a commerce marketplace across Facebook and Instagram. He enjoys growing businesses, the craft of product management, and building teams that earn a reputation for solving challenging problems.",GOPPROF-02
What exercises and reading do you recommend to develop a better Product Sense and Product Strategy mindset? ,GOPPROF-02
"Good question! I think this is one area where learning by doing is ideal IMO. I recommend looking at a bunch of apps you use frequently, picking one, and asking yourself the following questions:",GOPPROF-02
You can even take this further to focus on the execution pieces after the product strategy pieces listed above. ,GOPPROF-02
Usually reading blogs by founders of the companies is useful to see what worked for them so you start building an intuition for that company before you undertake the exercise I listed above. Do this for a few different products and you’ll feel quite confident to tackle ambiguity going forward.,GOPPROF-02

How do you deal with complexity?,GOPPROF-02
Depends on the complexity.,GOPPROF-02
"Product complexity: Keep coming back to the goals of what you’re trying to solve, to help clarify what’s important and cut through a lot of the noise.",GOPPROF-02
"People complexity: Make sure everyone has the context of why you’re undertaking something, what the goals are, what the constraints are, and drive alignment from there. Be mindful of people’s incentives and find ways to create win-win situations for multiple stakeholders.",GOPPROF-02
"Post your move from a technical role to a PM role, how did you change how you behave in meetings? ",GOPPROF-02
"This is interesting! My particular transition was from analyst/engineer to becoming an entrepreneur which was a difficult, but super helpful transition as I moved into PM.",GOPPROF-02
"As a PM, you have to be able to: ",GOPPROF-02

"Qualitative research is super useful in understanding the “why” behind the quantitative data. While quantitative data is imperative to learning “how” features perform at scale, qualitative data drives: ",GOPPROF-02
It is a great way to unlock new areas of investment for that reason.,GOPPROF-02

How do manage different departments so they come to an agreement on a decision or a feature?,GOPPROF-02
"This is an important aspect of PM that, when done well, separates the great from the good. I actually spoke about this in detail in a Product School talk a few months ago. But the TLDR is:",GOPPROF-02
What are the top 2 metrics you handle at Facebook?,GOPPROF-02
"I currently work on Facebook Dating. While I’m not sure I can share the exact metrics, teams at FB typically anchor on a company-wide or larger metric which for FB (the blue app) can be user sessions, as well as internal product metrics. ",GOPPROF-02
"So in our case, ultimately we want to drive dates, but we focus on a proxy metric since dates are harder to measure at this time. Each sub-team within Dating will own sub-metrics that ladder up to that Dating team metric.",GOPPROF-02

How do you plan out a career journey in Product Management?,GOPPROF-02
"Plan backward from where you want to ideally be in 5 years. Are you optimizing for learning, career progress, mission alignment, etc.? Be very clear with yourself on “why” you’re optimizing for one thing or another. ",GOPPROF-02
"There is no single right answer – it is all completely personal to you. There’s a list of career values that you can then look at to see what you have in your current job and what is missing from a 5-year look back and daily satisfaction standpoint. Pick the top 5 career values for you, and only consider roles that are meaningfully better in the things you’re trying to optimize for.",GOPPROF-02
Is having a programming background a basic requirement for being a PM in a leading software company?,GOPPROF-02
"Not at all. A lot of senior product leaders have English literature backgrounds. Just familiarize yourself with basic CS concepts (server-client, databases etc.) and you’ll be fine.",GOPPROF-02

What is the best way for a recent graduate to get a PM/APM role?,GOPPROF-02
Find an APM/Rotational PM role at a company like Facebook and prepare hard for the interviews. It’s competitive but it’s the best way to get your foot through the door. Smaller companies usually hire experienced PMs for the most part. ,GOPPROF-02
Another alternative is to join a young company as an engineer/marketer etc. and then transition into product after you’ve proven your skills in your domain.,GOPPROF-02
"When developing a business structure and resources for a new product, what are the most critical roles to fill first?",GOPPROF-02
"If you have 1 builder (engineer) and 1 seller (marketing/sales), those are really the only required components in terms of the founding team. In the beginning, most other things can be outsourced.",GOPPROF-02

Pick working on a problem that: ,GOPPROF-02
Check out: What Do Product Teams REALLY Want In Teammates?,GOPPROF-02
Any final advice?,GOPPROF-02
"My advice would be to pick well. As a PM, one can only be successful if the problem we work on is an important one to solve. Know what you enjoy working on, what your goals are, and pick products/companies/people accordingly. Having impact and enjoying the journey as a PM is much easier when those aspects are in place. ",GOPPROF-02

"""Our number one priority? Moving from a project to a product philosophy."" This is how a customer started a recent call with our Customer Success team. This type of transformation is undoubtedly a big effort — but it is not unique to any one company or industry. At Aha! we are seeing all types of organizations pushing their teams to embrace a product mentality. The process requires fundamentally changing how you think about delivering value.",GOPPROF-02
"So what does it look like in practice? Teams with a product mindset are strategic, agile, and customer-driven. They typically take a long-term view of what they offer, delivering and iterating frequently to improve the overall experience. They focus on outcomes rather than output, and measure success by the value they create for customers and for the business.",GOPPROF-02
"Compare this to a traditional project mindset, which is often more tactical and inward-focused. IT projects start with what is possible with new technology versus what problem customers are trying to solve. (Those customers can be internal or external.) Project thinking is about functionality not outcomes. It is about technology not people. ",GOPPROF-02
"IT groups are learning to partner with end users and empathize with what those users need. Continuous value exchange in the form of meaningful interactions deepens that relationship. Shifting to a product and customer-driven way of thinking is a massive undertaking when you have been insular and focused on speeds and feeds. It requires upskilling teammates, bolstering knowledge of product management principles, and selecting tools to facilitate new methods of working. ",GOPPROF-02
"This is why almost every IT group that our Customer Success team at Aha! works with is talking transformation. Based on our experience, here are the biggest areas of challenge we see teams face when adopting a product mindset — with four real-life examples from customers we have helped:",GOPPROF-02
"Strategy should inform everything you do. Tying the “what” of your work back to the “why"" enables you to make strategic decisions about where to invest resources. Instead of spending months pursuing unrelated projects or waiting for a behemoth spec to be completed, you can focus on the releases and features that deliver value to customers. But you need tools to help you prioritize what is most important.",GOPPROF-02
Our Customer Success team worked with a pharmaceutical company that wanted to break their work down along product-centric lines to get releases out more quickly. So they implemented a prioritization methodology using scorecards to assess the impact of each item in their backlog. Different teams could see a quantitative measure of the value of each item and understand how it aligned with the broader company and product goals.,GOPPROF-02
"Inertia is powerful. Big companies move especially slow. It can be difficult to convince folks to move away from the status quo (even if it is clearly not working). This is why it is crucial to gain buy-in from the rest of the organization. Executives, portfolio managers, and product managers will need to convince the broader team of the benefits. A huge part of driving this change is increasing people's knowledge of product management principles.",GOPPROF-02
"For example, we worked with a major financial services company that came to Aha! after deciding to apply a product mindset. They hired a group of experienced product managers and trained existing employees on the fundamentals of the discipline. Leaders also reorganized and expanded teams to include representatives from business, product, and IT to create de-facto product teams. This encouraged cross-functional collaboration and a more seamless approach to the work.",GOPPROF-02
"Any transformation will include significant process changes. First, define and document a product management lifecycle process that all teams can use. Include clear phases, approvals, and status workflows at both the initiative and release level. Then build internal applications or find third-party tools that help everyone work more efficiently. This increases visibility into plans and unites everyone around a shared goal.",GOPPROF-02
We helped an IT portfolio team at a global technology company with process improvements. They wanted to easily create a roadmap and highlight how their work was serving different internal groups. So the team began using Aha! to identify personas across all the IT organizations and link new planned capabilities to them. Bringing end users into their planning process allowed them to report on upcoming workloads for all personas and share how IT work impacted other teams throughout the company.,GOPPROF-02
"Focusing on the costs of technology can feel safe and is always known. No gray area. But just focusing on the investment is no longer enough. As I mentioned above, helping the team and the company achieve its goals is what really matters. IT organizations need new data-driven ways to report on their real impact for the business.",GOPPROF-02
"A telecommunications company came to us looking to make this type of transition — from only reporting on costs to delivering what end users actually wanted and to start tracking how it benefited them. Tracking efficiency and revenue-generating metrics was key. After every program and sprint, they asked themselves a few foundational questions. ""Is revenue increasing? Is customer acquisition going up? Are costs going down?"" ",GOPPROF-02
"There is a reason that IT groups at most companies are referring to these monumental shifts as being transformational. It takes considerable time and effort to change how an entire ecosystem functions. If you are at the beginning of this journey, have patience.  ",GOPPROF-02

"Last week I participated in a Product Owner course facilitated by Gunther Verheyen. What triggered me was the part where we discussed the difference between having a project- or product focus. I've seen many organizations, Scrum Teams and especially Product Owners struggle with finding the balance. In this blog post, I'll share my thoughts about the difference between having a project or a product mindset.",GOPPROF-02
"First of all, there’s nothing wrong with a project. It's a great approach to realize a set of activities over an agreed period of time to achieve a particular purpose. A project can offer the necessary focus and stimulate collaboration and teamwork towards realizing ambitious and appealing goals.
Although the project's can be a great approach, they are often used incorrectly. Organizations kickstart lots of projects with temporary teams whose main focus is to deliver on time, under budget, and within scope. All these constraints are set in stone. When the earlier made agreements made are accomplished, the project has declared a success.
Other smells that often occur within a project culture is assigning developers based on their availability in the 'resource planning tool' and hereby continuously changing the team composition. Big upfront designs. Project management via Gantt charts. Extensive reporting with lots of irrelevant information, and having developers explain every hour they've spent.
Of course deadlines, budget, and scope are important, but in the end, it’s all about building the right product for the customer. It's about continuously optimizing the delivered value. A project that meets all the deadlines, within budget and with the original agreed upon scope can still result in a crappy product. Or to put it more bluntly: it will result in a crappy product. It means you haven't learned anything during the project or you haven't responded on gained lessons learned.",GOPPROF-02
"I rather focus on the actual product instead of a temporary project. Products also tend to have a longer lifetime than projects. Compose fixed, steady teams. Focus on the outcome teams deliver instead of the output. Give teams the freedom and responsibility to think of a strategy they believe will result in the best product for our clients. Facilitate teams in setting up a process that supports them in building these products. Stimulate teams to pull work instead of pushing it. This will result in a clear focus for the Development Team and offers the opportunity for a sustainable pace of continuous delivery.
Using such a product mindset means measuring success with business metrics like user adoption and retention, and the revenue or cost savings generated per feature. This leads to less waste, more creativity, and more releases (from Scrum.org training material).
Great Product Owners understand that although there is value in using a project approach, they prefer a product mindset and thereby:",GOPPROF-02
"In this blog post, I've described my take on the difference between having a project or product mindset. Of course, the distinction isn't always this clear and for sure there's nothing wrong with projects. However, the often accompanied smells are wrong. Try to prevent or mitigate them.
What's is the mindset that is most common in your organization? What's your own mindset? Do you celebrate the success of a project or a product? Or both? I'm eager to learn from your experiences with this topic!",GOPPROF-02

"Project objectives are what you plan to achieve by the end of your project. This might include deliverables and assets, or more intangible objectives like increasing productivity or motivation. Your project objectives should be attainable, time-bound, specific goals you can measure at the end of your project.",PROC27
,PROC27
"Project objectives are a critical element of project management—without them, you don’t have a succinct way to communicate your goals before and during the project, nor do you have a measurable way to evaluate your success after the project ends.",PROC27
"If you’re just getting started with project objectives, here’s how they differ from other project management elements:",PROC27
"Though some teams may use these interchangeably, there is a distinct difference between project goals vs. objectives. In general, project goals are higher-level than project objectives. Your project goals should outline what happens once your project is successful, and how your project aligns with overall business objectives.",PROC27
"Project objectives, on the other hand, are more detailed and specific than project goals. Though many project objectives may impact business objectives, your project objectives are more focused on your actual, specific deliverables at the end of the project.",PROC27
Example of a project objective: Add five new ways for customers to find the feedback form in-product within the next two months.,PROC27
Example of a project goal: Make it easier for the engineering team to receive and respond to customer feedback.,PROC27
"Project objectives are just that—objectives and performance indicators for individual projects. Your project objectives should apply to the project they’re about, and they should be specific enough to guide your team in evaluating project success.",PROC27
"Business objectives are bigger than a single project. Unlike project objectives, your business objectives will fuel your business trajectory and velocity. Your business objectives should be long-term guidelines for your entire company or department. They will guide your company goals for a quarter or year, and they should be written in whatever goal-setting methodology your team uses, like objectives and key results (OKRs).",PROC27
Example of a project objective: Increase our company Net Promoter Score (NPS) to 62 by the end of the quarter.,PROC27
Example of a business objective: Become the premier service provider in our category.,PROC27
"Your project plan is a blueprint of the key elements your team needs to accomplish in order to successfully achieve your project goals and objectives. However, your project plan should include several additional key elements, like your project stakeholders, deliverables, timeline, and more.",PROC27
"Plan to create your project objectives before working on your project plan, since your objectives will likely drive other elements of your project plan, like deliverables and success metrics. But once your project objectives are written, you’ll likely share them with stakeholders by way of the project plan.",PROC27
Example of a project objective: Increase click through rate (CTR) engagement on email by 10% by the end of Q3.,PROC27
Example of a project plan: See an example plan in our guide to project planning.,PROC27
,PROC27
"At first glance, “objectives” and “milestones” sound like the same thing—they’re both targets within a project. But project milestones, in general, should be smaller in scope than project objectives.",PROC27
"A project milestone is a checkpoint that marks a specific achievement in your project timeline. Milestones themselves don’t represent work—rather, they record the accomplishment of a group of tasks or deliverables. While project milestones are important, your project objectives encompass your whole project.",PROC27
"Example of a project objective: Obtain 20,000 RSVPs to our virtual event before the closing date for signups (June 23rd).",PROC27
"Example of a project milestone: June 8th, 2021: Web page promotion upcoming virtual event goes live.",PROC27
"Project deliverables are the assets you want to have at the end of your project—in a marketing campaign, for example, a deliverable could be a new ad or a web page. In general, your project objectives will define what your deliverables are—but your objectives should also be broader than your deliverables.",PROC27
"In addition to capturing deliverables, your project objectives will also define the benefits and outcomes to come from those deliverables, especially as they relate to the grander scheme of your project goals and business objectives.",PROC27
Example of a project objective: Reduce monthly customer churn to >1% before the end of the year.,PROC27
Example of a deliverable: Launch winback campaign for all lapsed customers.,PROC27
"A clear project objective helps you know where you’re going with your project. Without a project objective, you don’t have an easy way to know if your project succeeded or failed—nor can you plan improvements for the next project you work on.",PROC27
"When team members don’t have a clear sense of how their work fits into the larger project and company goals, they’re less motivated and less engaged. According to the Asana Goals Report, only 26% of knowledge workers have a clear understanding of how their individual work contributes toward company goals. Granted, your project objectives aren’t company goals—but they’re the middle step that connects individual work to your project work to your company goals.",PROC27
"So when you have clearly-defined project objectives, your team members can consistently evaluate their work and refocus on the objectives if they’ve gotten misaligned. Think of your objectives as a compass to help your team continue moving in the right direction.",PROC27
"The secret to writing great project objectives is to create objectives that are clearly written and helpful. You can do this by using the SMART methodology, which stands for:",PROC27
Specific,PROC27
Measurable,PROC27
Achievable,PROC27
Realistic,PROC27
Time-bound,PROC27
"For a full walkthrough of this methodology, read our article to learn how to write better SMART goals. ",PROC27
"In order for your objectives to guide the results of the project, you need to set them at the beginning and use them to guide your project. As we mentioned earlier, your project objectives are a key element of your project plan, which you should also create at the beginning of your project.",PROC27
"The more buy-in you get, the more successful your project objectives will be. Your stakeholders need to have a clear understanding of the objectives of the project, so they can approach the rest of your project plan and the work that happens during the project most effectively.",PROC27
"If this is your first time writing a project objective, you may be tempted to outline every detail—but try to keep your project objective short if you can. Think of it as a statement to guide the results of your project—your project objective statement should be about one to two sentences long. The additional information, like your project budget or stakeholders, will be captured in your project plan.",PROC27
"This is where the SMART acronym comes in to play to help you create clearly-defined, realistic, and controllable project objectives. There are five elements to this framework:",PROC27
Specific. Make sure your project objective statement clearly covers the project your team is currently working on. Avoid writing overly broad project objectives that don’t directly connect to the result of the project.,PROC27
"Measurable. At the end of your project, you need a way to clearly look back and determine if your project was a success. Make sure your project objectives are clearly measurable things—like percentage change or a specific number of assets.",PROC27
"Achievable. Are your project objectives something you can reasonably hope to achieve within your project? this is connected to your project scope—if your project scope is unrealistic, your project objectives likely will be, too. Without Achievable project goals, your project may suffer from scope creep, delays, or overwork.",PROC27
"Realistic. When you’re creating your project objectives, you should have a general sense of your project resources. Make sure your objectives are something you can achieve within the time frame and with the resources you have available for this project.",PROC27
Time-bound. Your project objectives should take into account how long your project timeline is. Make sure you factor in the time you have available to work on your project.,PROC27
,PROC27
"Employees who understand how their individual work adds value to their organization are 2X as motivated. In order to keep your team aligned and motivated, make sure to check in and update them on your project objectives frequently. In your project status reports, include a section that connects back to your project objectives. Share whether your current project is on track, at risk, or off track. That way, your project team can recalibrate if necessary and move forward in a way that best contributes to your project objectives.",PROC27
"It’s not easy to write a project objective, and it’ll take time for you to get in the groove of writing these for your projects. That’s ok! Check out these three examples of good and bad objectives to help you write your own:",PROC27
Bad: Launch new home page.,PROC27
"This project objective is missing many important characteristics. Though this objective is measurable, achievable, and realistic, it’s not specific or time-bound. When should the home page be live? What should the redesign focus on?",PROC27
"Good: Create net-new home page assets and copy, focusing on four customer stories and use cases. Launch refreshed, customer-centric home page by the end of Q2.",PROC27
"This project objective is solid. It’s specific (create net-new home page assets and copy), measurable (launch refreshed, customer-centric home page), achievable and realistic (focusing on four customer stories and use cases), and time bound (by the end of Q2).",PROC27
Bad: Increase sustainability in our production process by 5%,PROC27
"Though this project objective is more specific than the previous bad example, it’s still lacking several important characteristics. This objective is measurable (by 5%), but it’s not specific or time-bound, since we don’t specify what “sustainability” means or by when the production process should improve. As a result, we don’t really know if it’s achievable or realistic.",PROC27
Good: Reduce operational waste by 5% and increase use of recycled products by 20% in the next 12 weeks.,PROC27
"This project objective builds upon the previous one, because we now have a specific objective. This project objective also includes a way to measure the goal (by 5%... by 20%). The objective is a little ambitious, but the fact that it’s time-bound (in the next 12 weeks) makes it both achievable and realistic.",PROC27
Bad: Improve performance reviews,PROC27
"Believe it or not, most personal project objectives aren’t specific or measurable. That’s because we have a hard time turning success metrics inwards, onto ourselves. But in order to know if we improved and achieved our personal goals, we need to create a clearer project objective.",PROC27
Good: Get at least a 4/5 on both the March and September performance reviews in 2021.,PROC27
"Here, we have a project objective that checks all of the right boxes: it’s specific (get at least a 4/5), measurable (4/5), achievable and realistic (4/5 gives us room for any unanticipated difficulties), and time-bound (in 2021).",PROC27
,PROC27
"Setting a project objective can help your team gain clarity, align on work, and get more work done. But remember: project objectives are just one part of your overall project plan. To learn more about how you can increase clarity and alignment during the project planning stage, read our guide to writing project plans.",PROC27

"Definition: A project objective defines the “what” part of the project. The “what” must be possible, sensible, and able to be completed within a given duration. An objective sets the project’s goals and provides stepping stones for a project’s success.",PROC27
"This article describes project objectives, provides examples, and explains how to write them.",PROC27
Project objectives describe the aim of the project and set the goalposts for success. Project objectives are measurable and achievable; they push the team to stay on track. A project can have multiple objectives that can be achieved at different points over the course of the project. ,PROC27
"Project objectives should be clearly stated since they influence every decision during the project’s lifecycle. Objectives are measurable and include key performance indicators like budget, quality, schedule, etc. ",PROC27
The project objective is sometimes known as the objective statement.,PROC27
Project objectives make it possible to track the project’s progress. An effective project objective guides the project team throughout the project’s lifecycle and it should have buy-in from all stakeholders. ,PROC27
"Regardless of what project management methodology (agile or waterfall) they follow, all projects have project objectives.",PROC27
Goals and objectives are different. Setting goals and objectives early in the project life cycle help establish key progress indicators and act as a “road map” for a project team. Failure to do so can derail the project. ,PROC27
Undefined project goals and frequent changes in project objectives are common causes of project failure.,PROC27
"A goal is an achievable outcome that is broad and long-term. A project can have multiple high-level goals. A goal should not be specific or vague. For example, making investors happy to get funding is not a worthwhile goal. Measuring satisfaction and happiness is difficult, and it does not serve a business goal.",PROC27
Examples of acceptable project goals:,PROC27
"Objectives are specific and have smaller tasks that serve the broader goal. Goals are essential, but objectives power the engine.",PROC27
Examples of project objectives:,PROC27
"The above objectives show what needs to be accomplished. They are the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) format of goal setting.",PROC27
These objectives are the OKRs (objectives and key results) to help achieve the goals. ,PROC27
A review of project goals gives an idea about the objectives. Goals are what a business wants to achieve through a project. Objectives are short-term steps to achieve goals. The project managers must differentiate between goals and objectives and ensure that objectives support the organization’s goal.,PROC27
"A project manager can identify objectives by analyzing data and feedback. Opinions from customers, clients, and team members must be included in the goals. ",PROC27
Project-management specialist Tom Mochal gives an example in which a business plans to improve its telephone set-up to limit average caller wait time to less than sixty seconds. ,PROC27
This is an objective toward the goal of enhancing customer service. A project manager can identify this objective by analyzing customer surveys that disclose that a two-minute response is reasonable to wait for a call to go through the system.,PROC27
"Objectives are “SMART” if they are specific, measurable, achievable (sometimes agreed), realistic (or relevant), and time-bound (or timely). ",PROC27
"To set SMART project objectives, adhere to the following guidelines:",PROC27
"Specific: Outline requirements with clear statements; do not leave room for misinterpretation. Think of the five w’s (who, why, what, when, and where). ",PROC27
"Measurable: Ensure that the objective is measurable, so the organization can monitor progress and know when the objective has been achieved.",PROC27
"Achievable: Choose achievable objectives. They should be agreed upon by managers, clients, and team members to ensure everyone’s commitment.",PROC27
Realistic: Set realistic objectives so the project team can believe it is achievable. It will motivate them to reach the objective.,PROC27
Time-bound: Include a specific date or duration by which the objectives should be achieved and get team members’ agreement. ,PROC27
The following steps will help write robust project objectives.,PROC27
An organization may have internal challenges or behavior of team members that can affect the project objectives. Assess past projects and identify the behaviors or conditions that need to be changed. ,PROC27
Identifying these issues helps project managers prioritize the project objectives. This creates a foundation to build robust and SMART project objectives.,PROC27
"Management should define the purpose of the project, its objectives, and explain how success should be defined. This helps the project team understand what success would look like, provides guidance, and motivates them to achieve the project objectives.",PROC27
"In order to define a project’s “success,” it is essential to write down the possible outputs and challenges using SWOT (strength, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis.",PROC27
"Describe the focus group for the project. For example, a focus may be collecting leads, websites, systems, customer surveys, turnover, sales, profitability, etc. ",PROC27
"The focus can be different for each objective; therefore, describe the focus in detail to provide the right direction. ",PROC27
"For example, suppose a company wants to focus on profitability, aims to minimize plastic waste, and become a more eco-friendly company. However, these changes will increase manufacturing costs and reduce profitability. Therefore, this problem calls for rethinking that particular project objective.",PROC27
"Mention the timeframe for achieving the objective and location, such as region or country. The time suggests an objective achievement date, such as the third quarter, annually, etc.",PROC27
The organization has a lot of information when writing project objectives. They must narrow this information and make brief objectives but still contain all necessary information. The best way is to write several versions and select the best one.,PROC27
"A project objective should be a brief, one-sentence statement that includes actionable, measurable goals. ",PROC27
Some best practices for writing project objectives are given below.,PROC27
A few examples of project objectives are given below:,PROC27
"By June 2022, our senior web development team will develop a remodeled website, including a new logo, using their additional eight hours per week. Every Monday, they’re going to give us an update report on what they’ve achieved and what they still have left to finish. We’re allotting them a budget of 6,000 USD to complete the project.",PROC27
"Our sales team plans to increase revenue by 20% by mid-year by offering consumers 1% more coupons in their mailboxes and inboxes. At the end of each quarter, we will track the sales made using the coupons.",PROC27
"Our objective is to create one-time-use products that are more sustainable for the environment following the state’s recently passed sustainability legislation. By August 2022, we plan to have single-use straws, containers, and utensils that are more environmentally friendly. We plan to use bamboo for these products because it’s manufactured mechanically instead of chemically. We will conduct weekly production inspections to ensure the project progresses on time.",PROC27
Good objectives follow the SMART checklist and have all achievable elements. ,PROC27
"Bad objectives are not SMART. They lack specifics, don’t rely upon actions, or focus on a means to an end.",PROC27
"A  project objective should be SMART. A well-defined objective helps complete the project with minimal hassle by providing clear expectations for stakeholders. Project objectives motivate team members, provide clarity, and align their effort with the organizational goals. ",PROC27

"Examine ten projects at random, and you will see some of the worst written objectives. Project objectives are often hard to track, vague, and lacking in depth. In project objectives, people need details to help know where they are in the process, and data helps them make informed decisions. I like to recommend ""DISCO"" when forming objectives. ""DISCO"" can be spelled out to point us in the proper direction for creating project objectives and tracking their progress.",PROC27
"Give as much information as possible and make these objectives very specific. Far too many objectives have been set, which are very grey in nature and lack data to help team members understand all specifics.",PROC27
"Objectives must be measured. When you look at an objective, you must ask, Can we measure this? If not, it needs to be rewritten so that it can be measured and tracked for successful completion. The only way to do this is to make sure qualitative and quantitative components are set.",PROC27
"Qualitative measurements measure a project based on quality standards, quality indicators, or quality characteristics. Defect ratio, break down ratio, and improvement needs are all to be considered. Each of these can be prioritised and broken down into a specific tracking mechanism to follow and monitor.",PROC27
"Quantitative measurements measure the project based on numerical indicators. Some of the most common quantitative measurements are time, budget, production, work hours, process time, and development progress. Quantitative measurements normally include the need to set a series of benchmarks as a starting point to begin tracking.",PROC27
"Making sure the team agrees with the measurement is very important. Sometimes objectives are set at the beginning of the project, and they are very loose. When the team sets a standard of measurement, it will usually be detailed and understandable. It is important because the team needs to be on the same page during planning. They must agree that these standards are the best possible measurements considering the project.",PROC27
"The approach for reaching objectives is very important. Unless the approach is understood by the entire team and supported, there will be conflict in the team's processes. Conflict means you will have people going in different directions and using various methods.",PROC27
Setting up a timeline and follow it. This timeline must make sense and be publicised to the entire team. You must constantly focus on maintaining clarity.,PROC27
"An example of a great DISCO objective is, We will design 15 training courses that meet organisational development guidelines by June 30 with a budget of $483,000. We will include courses on supervision, communication, performance appraisals, and creating an optimistic workplace. DISCO objectives can be very successful in pushing the project forward and bridging the gap for communication. However, good objectives will never write themselves, nor will they track themselves.",PROC27

"Included on this page, you'll learn what a project objective is, examples of successful project objectives, tips on how to craft a clear, concise objective using the S.M.A.R.T. method, and much more.",PROC27
"A project objective states the desired results of a project at its outset, including goals and deliverables. An objective should be specific and measurable, and identify any time, budget, and quality constraints.",PROC27
"Objectives can be used in project planning for business, government, nonprofit organizations, and even for personal use (for example, in resumes to describe the exact position a job-seeker wants). A project may have one objective, many parallel objectives, or several objectives that must be achieved sequentially. To produce the most benefit, objectives must be defined early in the project life cycle, in phase two, the planning phase. ",PROC27
Benefits of the Well-Written Objective,PROC27
"A well written objective is crucial because it can affect every step of the project life cycle. When you create a specific objective, you give your team a greater chance of achieving the objective because they know precisely what they’re working towards. Clear project objectives also support the current emphasis on total quality management: every member of the team can consider themselves responsible for quality, because the whole team can see the desired outcome from the beginning of the project. ",PROC27
"All types of endeavors can benefit from objectives. As an individual, you may use an objective to target exactly what to plan for. For example, you may know you want to go to graduate school, but finding an objective will help you to understand that you want to obtain a sociology degree at your local community college and to graduate in six years. A small nonprofit group may use objectives to determine that success for a recycling education program is when 40 percent of households in a county request free composting buckets. A construction company might use objectives to keep a building project on schedule and within budget. ",PROC27

"You may encounter several definitions of objectives, such as vision statements and business goals. While these terms are often used interchangeably, we’ve outlined the relationships among them to help you use them correctly:    ",PROC27
"Vision Statement -  A statement that expresses the high-level intention of a project (often with lofty or unachievable goals). For example, a school may aim for perfect pupil attendance or a company may strive for 100% customer satisfaction. ",PROC27
Business Goals - A company creates these to describe the overall outcomes it wants to accomplish in a certain time frame. Business goals are captured in business plans.     ,PROC27
"Goals - A high-level, broad, non-specific, and long-term definition of what the group or organization wants to accomplish. Goals are not measurable, and several discrete projects may be needed to achieve a goal. Some people say that project goals do not need to be defined, so long as a project manager understands the business goals. However, project objectives are always needed. In a business, project goals are influenced by business goals. ",PROC27
"Objectives - Influenced by goals, an objective is a low-level description of the specific and measureable outcomes desired from a project. Activities and most likely deliverables will contribute to achieving the objective. The project and its objectives must always contribute to the goal, otherwise the project should not be attempted.
        
Bottomline: Goals are high-level, general statements about the aims of the project, while objectives are detailed statements about what the project should accomplish. ",PROC27
"Activities - This is what your team will do to achieve the objective. An activity can be a specific action or a process, and many activities will likely be involved to meet objectives. As with everything in project management, the key consideration for activities is that they contribute directly to achieving the objective, and thereby the goal. ",PROC27
"Deliverables - A specific, tangible product or thing, like a report or a software app. One or more deliverables may contribute to achieving an objective, but it is important not to define the objective as a deliverable. In other words, if the objective is written at too low a level, you risk creating the wrong deliverables. Rather, the objective is there to guide you and the team to determine what products or processes are needed. For example, say you have difficulty falling asleep each night. You may decide that your objective is to buy relaxing chamomile tea. Drinking the tea might help, but if your objective had been to ensure at least seven hours of sleep a night by the following month, you might have explored other solutions that would have greater benefits, such as making sure to get an hour of exercise every day.
    
Requirements - A description of features and functions. Objectives should not include features and functions. ",PROC27
"SMART objectives are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound. To write SMART goals, consider the key performance indicators (KPIs) that are specific to your business or project. ",PROC27
"Specific: Define your objectives clearly, in detail, leaving no room for misinterpretation. Think of the five w’s (who, what, when, where, and why). ",PROC27
Measurable: State the measures and performance specifications you’ll use to determine whether you’ve met your objectives.  ,PROC27
Achievable or Attainable: Choose objectives that the team has a reasonable expectation of successfully completing. ,PROC27
Realistic: Set objectives the project team believes it can achieve. Relevant objectives align with group or company goals.,PROC27
Time-bound: Include the date or specific period by which you’ll achieve the objectives.,PROC27
"If you’re interested in creating S.M.A.R.T. goals, use our template as a guide. ",PROC27
"Objectives and Indicators
In some project management guides, you may also find reference to objectives and indicators. This is a different way of expressing the S.M.A.R.T. criteria. An objective may be stated as, Children in x county shall read better. The indicators would be, 60 percent of children under age 13 read at the appropriate reading level for their age.",PROC27
"A project objective should be a brief, one-sentence statement that includes actionable, measurable goals. We’ve outlined some best practices for writing a successful project objective below.",PROC27

"Project objectives are goals, plain and simple. These are the business objectives that you want the project to accomplish. Within project management, it is of the utmost importance that a project's objectives are stated clearly, as these will impact every decision in the project lifecycle.",PROC27
"Project objectives must be measurable and contain key performance indicators that will be used to assess a project's overall success. These indicators will often include criteria such as budget, quality, and time to completion.",PROC27
"So, what are project objectives in project management? Simply put, they are the specific milestones and achievements that are necessary for accomplishing your project goals.",PROC27
"Project management objectives serve a very specific purpose. They break down the key steps to achieving overall project success. For example, if your main project goal is to increase customer renewals by 20% year-on-year, your objectives would consist of smaller milestones and key results to service this main goal.",PROC27
"Project objectives also let teams know what they should be focused on, what they should devote resources to, and how their activities serve wider business and organizational goals.",PROC27
"When setting objectives, be sure to avoid vague or confusing language. For example, “Make the business more successful by next year” would not be a good project objective. To write more effective project objectives, team leaders can use the SMART goal-setting framework.",PROC27
"SMART objectives are goals outlined using the SMART goal system. In this framework, SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound. When writing out your project objectives, make sure to tie them into the bigger picture of your project and your business as a whole. ",PROC27
"Your SMART objectives should be concise, realistic, and specific statements that tie into the overall goals of the project or business. They shouldn’t be long-winded, overarching, or unrealistic. ",PROC27
"When writing your project objectives, you can look at what’s realistic based on what was accomplished in previous similar projects. Alternatively, you could check out which KPIs you used last time that you can use to measure results this time around. ",PROC27
"Example A: The team will remain under a budget of $5,000 as they complete the marketing campaign set to launch on the 30th day of the month.",PROC27

"When working as a project manager in a fast-paced environment, it’s not unheard of to plow full speed ahead into a project that was dropped on your lap without fully understanding the project’s objectives.",PROC27
That’s why you need to get into the habit of writing down complete and thorough project objectives before you put even an iota of effort into the project at hand.,PROC27
Not sure how? You’re not alone. Even some of the most seasoned project managers end up walking before they crawl. It’s never too late to go back to the basics and make sure you have a solid foundation for every project.,PROC27
"But first, let’s start with a quick definition of project objectives.",PROC27
"A project objective is the what, when, and why of every project – what is the project (action items), why are you doing it (desired result), when does it need to happen (deadline). ",PROC27
That’s a question that is often asked and is the source of a lot of confusion. ,PROC27
Let’s settle it once and for all. ,PROC27
"Just think about it like this: Goals are the general long-term outcome you want to achieve (seldom by one project alone), while objectives are the measurable actions you take to help you achieve a goal.",PROC27
For example:,PROC27
"There are endless objectives that a project can have, all depending on your company department and industry, but it can be helpful to find a way to categorize them into organized groups. By labeling each project with a broad category, you can apply a more holistic approach to your overall project management. ",PROC27
"So, while not to paint the vast range of project objectives with too fine a brush, here are the 3 different categories you can use to boil them down:",PROC27
"Financial project objectives – This type of objective typically focuses on how the project impacts the organization’s financial performance. However, as projects that make money cost money, it’s important to define a clear and measurable objective to achieve the target without losing sight of your costs.",PROC27
For example: Launching a pay-per-click marketing campaign that will produce a 150% ROI (return on investment) within 2 months.,PROC27
Quality project objectives – This type of objective focuses on upgrading the quality of services or products delivered to customers in order to improve outcomes and get you closer to your business goals. Regulatory requirements and compliance objectives can also fit under this umbrella.,PROC27
For example: Updating the interface of the payment page to reduce abandoned carts by 15% by the end of Q2.,PROC27
Technical objectives – This type of objective focuses on improving overall project management and technical efficiency to streamline work processes and generate better results. ,PROC27
For example: Implementing a new work operating system across the company that will reduce repetitive tasks by 50% within two months.,PROC27
Defining the category of each objective will ultimately make it easier to organize and prioritize company projects as well as track and manage objectives based on their grouping.,PROC27
Get started,PROC27
Now for the part you’ve all been waiting for – the formula to writing a project objective.,PROC27
"While there are quite a few different formulas, each with its own merits, we recommend incorporating the SMART practice.",PROC27
"If you work in the field of project management, chances are you’ve heard this term before. SMART is a standard project management criteria for developing objectives and is the best way to proof your projects.",PROC27
,PROC27

How does this example fall into the SMART practice?,PROC27
Need a place to organize your project objectives and categories? We got you covered.,PROC27
Get started,PROC27
"It’s also important to remember that defining project objectives cannot be done by the project manager alone. With goals set at the company level, there is also a need to consult with everyone involved to make sure that the objectives are doable.",PROC27
The bottom line is that you need to define what success looks like if you want to reach it.,PROC27
"At the risk of repeating ourselves, we’ll wrap this up by reminding you that an objective is the very reason you run a project and should be the first thing defined during your kick-off meeting.",PROC27
"Clear project objectives serve as the foundation for any project, no matter what the size. Once an objective is written and approved, it represents the agreement between the project manager, company management, and project stakeholders on the purpose of the project. ",PROC27

"Project objectives are a set of short-term goals that aim to achieve the final long-term goal of a project. Simply speaking, they are what you wish to achieve by the end of your project.",PROC27
A well-defined project objective guides you and gives you directions for achieving your final target.,PROC27
"Basically, they are the what, when, and why of your project. This means that your project objective decides what your project is, why you are doing it or what your desired results are, and when you need to achieve it.",PROC27
Defining the category of each objective will ultimately make it easier for you to organize and prioritize your company projects as well as track and manage objectives based on their grouping.,PROC27
"You can divide your project objective into different categories, like financial project objective, quality project objective, technical project objective, etc. so that it’s easier to track, manage, organize and prioritize each one.",PROC27
That’s why your project objective might include different short-term goals from increasing ROI to improving quality and boosting efficiency and productivity.,PROC27
Now comes the question: how are project objectives different from project goals? Let’s take a look!,PROC27
 ,PROC27
It’s a very common mistake to use the terms objectives and goals interchangeably despite the distinct difference between the two.,PROC27
"We already discussed that project objectives are short-term goals that aim to achieve the final long-term goal of a project. However, project goals are high-level statements that give direction to what the project is trying to achieve in the long term.",PROC27
,PROC27
"What makes the two different is the fact that project goals provide a broad and general statement to achieve the desired result while project objectives provide a highly detailed and specific target. While the goals aim to achieve the result over a long time frame, the objective aims to achieve in a smaller time frame.",PROC27

All project-related objectives must be clearly defined during the planning phase. This is to ensure that every team member is aware of all the important details even before the project starts.,PROC27
Now let’s take a look at the steps involved in creating effective project objectives for your business-related project:,PROC27
The first thing you need to do before setting your project objectives is to start your project with a vision statement. This could act as a high-level overview of where you want the project to be or what you want it to achieve.,PROC27
,PROC27
Your vision statement need not always be something achievable or attainable. It informs you about a goal that you need to achieve or work towards so that you have a general idea about the direction you should be following and a strategy you should be using.,PROC27
The ultimate goal is to inspire and motivate your entire team to achieve the final target.,PROC27

"Now that you have a vision statement to give you a general sense of direction, the next step is to outline your project goals. They are usually long-term and act as the driving force behind your objectives.",PROC27
"Here, you define in detail what you wish to accomplish with your project. This sets the tone for creating your project objectives.",PROC27
 ,PROC27
"Now that you have a rough outline of what you want to achieve, it’s time to get into the nitty-gritty of developing project objectives for your project.",PROC27
The best way to set effective project objectives is to follow the SMART criteria or framework. This means that your projective objectives should be:,PROC27
Specific ,PROC27
"When you set project objectives, make sure that they are clearly defined. It is here where you think about the who, what, where, when, and why of your project.",PROC27
Narrow your objectives if you want to get a very specific and concrete result.,PROC27
Measurable,PROC27
"Once you develop a specific project objective, the next step is to ensure that you quantify it. This means that you give a numerical value so that it is measurable.",PROC27
Make sure that your project objective is defined in terms of specific numbers of percentages so that you can measure your results and track your progress.,PROC27
Achievable,PROC27
Ensure that your project objectives are something that can be achieved by your entire team and their efforts.,PROC27
Ask yourself: are your project objectives reasonable and attainable? How can you accomplish it? This step helps you identify whether the objectives you set are achievable or not.,PROC27
"You have to make sure that you have the resources, knowledge, budget, labor, etc. to carry out your project goals and create objectives based on them. This will help you prevent delays, overwork, or anything that might hinder your project.",PROC27
Relevant,PROC27
The next step is to ensure that your project objectives are relevant to your project. This means that they should be able to achieve it within the constraints of the project.,PROC27
A relevant project objective should align with your other business goals and go hand-in-hand with your organizational values as well.,PROC27
Time-Bound,PROC27
The final criteria to be followed is to make sure that you have a clear idea about the time duration of your project.,PROC27
Your project objective should have a clear end date which will help your team members accomplish it in the given time span. This will ensure that no one gets distracted and help keep the team on a time track.,PROC27
 ,PROC27
"Once you have set your SMART project objectives, you need to constantly monitor it throughout the lifecycle of your project.",PROC27
"Make sure that you review, track and update your project objectives to find out if the efforts or results are off track or at risk.",PROC27
,PROC27
Frequent evaluations will help you identify areas that require improvement and how much you have progressed with the objectives.,PROC27
"In short, your project objectives should be attainable, time-bound, specific goals which you should be able to measure by the end of your project.",PROC27
"Wait! Before you go, we’d like to help you in the process of setting your project objectives with a special tool that we have to offer to you.",PROC27

Set clear targets and track progress in real time. Try ProjectManager and get dashboards and reporting tools to help you hit targets on time and under budget.,PROC27
"A project has a beginning and an end, but without an objective, it’s a rudderless ship. In order to steer your project successfully and land in a safe harbor, you’re going to have to define your project objectives.",PROC27
"Project objectives define the critical steps that must be taken to successfully execute a project plan. Project objectives can be tangible deliverables or intangible milestones, but they should always be SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timebound) and related to your broader project goals.",PROC27
"Project objectives allow you to communicate with your team and outline what individuals are responsible for what objectives to better meet stakeholder quality expectations. Your objectives should contain KPI metrics such as budget, quality and how long it takes to finish the project.",PROC27
"To keep track of project objectives, you’ll need a robust project management tool such as ProjectManager. ProjectManager is project management software that offers professional project tracking tools such as Gantt charts, task lists, calendars and real-time dashboards. ProjectManager allows you to track, manage and control project objectives with ease. Get started for free.",PROC27
"Before we learn how to write project objectives, we need to define terms. Many confuse the concept of project objectives with related project management concepts such as project goals, deliverables and milestones.",PROC27
"Project goals are high-level statements that can be somewhat vague. They do, however, provide overall context for what the project is set to achieve and how it aligns with business goals.",PROC27
"There are different types of project goals such as performance goals, time goals (referring to start and end dates) and resource goals. These three types of project goals compete with one another so a variable with one will impact the others.",PROC27
Objectives are much more specific and straightforward as they influence every decision in the project. Project objectives can also be defined as the steps that need to be taken to achieve the high-level view of project goals.,PROC27
"Project milestones mark an important point in time in your project, often marking the beginning of a new project phase. There can be as many milestones in your project plan as you see fit. They’re beneficial as they break down your project plan into more digestible parts.",PROC27
"Project deliverables are the outputs from your project activities. There can be as many project deliverables as you need in your project. Project deliverables take many forms, such as a product, service or even a finished infrastructure project.",PROC27
"Undoubtedly, effective objectives are important. The clearer your project objectives, the more likely they are to be achieved. Plus, your project will be that much easier to manage.",PROC27
Objectives are crucial as they offer a way to structure the project and validate its success. Think of these objectives as the guidelines that your project must follow. They steer you through every aspect of the project and its phases. They offer project managers measurable targets to hit and make teams understand what’s expected of them.,PROC27
Each project objective needs to meet the SMART criteria. This acronym will guide you to effective objectives.,PROC27
"How? By making sure each objective is specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound.",PROC27
That means defining the objective and making sure that there’s a metric to measure its progress so you can tell if it’s meeting your baseline expectations.,PROC27
"Your project objectives must be achievable or they’ll be impossible to reach, resulting in wasted time and resources. Make sure to be realistic with your objectives and ensure they are relevant to both the project and the organizational strategy of the business.",PROC27
"Lastly, your objective must have a deadline through a time constraint; it can’t be open-ended. It could be time-bound by months, weeks or days depending on the specifics of your project.",PROC27
"Project Goal: Increase the overall satisfaction level for customers by submitting support tickets through the website.
Project Objective: Implement a new online ticketing system by a certain date to achieve ticket response times of no more than an hour",PROC27
"Now, run it through SMART: is it specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound? If it meets these criteria, then it’s a SMART project objective.",PROC27
"In terms of the goal, how will it be reflected in performance, time and resources? You’ll also want to consider if this goal is in alignment with the corporate strategy.",PROC27
"Project Goal: Create a new product to be launched at the beginning of next quarter such as a pair of shoes.
Project Objectives: In this case, there are several project objectives related to that goal. Here are some project objectives examples.",PROC27
"Project Goal: Increase sales by 30 percent in the next quarter.
Project Objectives: In this case, there are several project objectives related to the goal. Here are some project objectives examples.",PROC27
"If you’re looking to define and achieve your project objectives, you need a dynamic project management tool. ProjectManager is work and project management software that tracks your objectives and goals with real-time metrics on our dashboard. With our software, SMART goals are easy to establish, track and achieve.",PROC27
Filter reports to show the data you want and generated shareable reports for stakeholders with just one click. Utilize our resource management tools to balance your workload and keep the project on track. Our online Gantt charts schedule over a timeline and can be easily edited by dragging and dropping start and due dates.,PROC27
What is your project about? The project objective states this before the project initiation. It will be a document you return to over and over again in the project in order to stay the course. This is true whether you’re working waterfall or within an agile framework.,PROC27
"The project objective is essential as it’s designed to help your team, the stakeholder (especially as they request changes) and the project manager. If you want that project objective to be as effective as possible, watch this short video by our resident project management expert, Jennifer Bridges, PMP.",PROC27
,PROC27
Here’s a screenshot for your reference.,PROC27
"Pro Tip: Don’t neglect business objectives. If the objective of the project isn’t aligned with the company strategy, then it’s not going to be effective.",PROC27
Thanks for watching!,PROC27
"Today, we’re talking about how to write effective project objectives every time. Well, I find sometimes people struggle with writing objectives because they get them confused with goals and even the vision. So I wanna start by clarifying what each one of these terms means.",PROC27
"So the vision statement is the highest level statement. What it’s doing, it’s showing direction and aspiration. It may or may not even be achieved, but the goals are, they’re more vague, but they’re still high level, they provide the overall context for what the project is to achieve and aligns with the business goals.",PROC27
"The objectives are a lower level statement, they describe the desired result of the project and they describe specific tangible products and deliverables that the project will deliver. So the goals are more vague and the objectives are a little bit more specific.",PROC27
So why do we care about effective objectives?,PROC27
"Well, managing a project calls for clear objectives. The more clear you can get your objectives, then the more likely you are to achieve them. So they’re used to structure the project and validate your success. So how do we make those objectives more effective?",PROC27
"Well, we use the SMART technique. So SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound. So when we talk about projects and we talk about goals and objectives, Here’s an example.",PROC27
"So if a goal for a project could be to increase the overall satisfaction of customers submitting support tickets through the website, that would be the overall goal of the project.",PROC27
So one specific objective would be to implement a new online ticketing system by August 1st to achieve ticket response times of no more than one hour. So let’s check it out. So is it SMART?,PROC27
"So it’s very specific, it tells you exactly what’s going to happen, by what time, and what results you’re going to gain. It’s also measurable. You can measure the ticket response times, and make sure they don’t exceed one hour.",PROC27
"They’re also achievable by using this ticketing system, they are able to be achieved and they’re realistic for your team. And also time-bound, you know you’re going to implement this by August 1st. So now you can see the difference between the goal and how the objective helps support that goal.",PROC27

"PRD, or the Product Requirements Document, is a keystone of your cooperation with an agency, and a proven tool to ensure the predictable outcome of your product development. It this post, we’ll decompose ‘the anatomy’ of PRD preparation, based on Fulcrum Rocks experience and client cases.",GOPPROF-01
"The product requirements document (PRD) is a ‘recipe’ for making a successful product. And a successful product is easy to maintain, develop, and change. It does not diminish when you have minor changes in your development team, and it brings profit in any form. You want your project to be complete and successful, for sure. Therefore, let’s write a good recipe for its preparation (development).",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"PRD is a description of the requirements for a particular product or service. It reflects how the product will look and work. You present your requirements either in a single document or a set of documents, or a set of artifacts (layouts, diagrams, diagrams, documents).",GOPPROF-01
"The requirements in this document reflect your vision and expectations for the product. A product requirements document is necessary for both parties — you and the contractor you choose. Technical specification will help the customer clearly define the project’s goals and objectives. Think about the strategy, and decide what they expect from the performer. The contractor needs the PRD document as the source information for the project.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"The discovery phase of a project is the first and mandatory development stage, where you should:",GOPPROF-01
"To make sure the expectations will coincide with the result, that is the stage when a PRD is being created. After getting acquainted with the project through the PRD document, you can conclude the actual amount of work, cost, and deadlines. Besides, the PRD is used to prepare for work on the project or during its release. The final result often depends on the completeness of the customer’s information and the elaboration of details.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
A PRD template is an excellent solution to make it comprehensible for everyone involved in product development. We here at Fulcrum Rocks use this PRD template:,GOPPROF-01
Below you can see the key components of the correct product requirements documents.,GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"This section should clearly describe the purpose of the product or project. It includes initiatives, goals, and vision. You can answer the following questions to make sure the section is complete and informative:",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"You need to decide on the time, and this information should be noted in this section. It is not just the product development time that matters. Decide on the amount of time to interact with the specialists involved. The total time frame may not coincide with the product launch date. Allow additional time for testing and making final adjustments. The PRD document’s release part allows us to focus on the milestones and dependencies to keep everyone on track.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
This stage is essential to write down all the product features that you expect to see in the release. The product requirements should be clearly specified for each feature.,GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
Make sure the section covers the following issues:,GOPPROF-01
"When you confirm the product design in the PRD, you will see what your product will look like. The more detailed the technical task for the design is, the more predictable the result will be. This is when you are thinking from the user’s perspective and provide mockups to understand better how the feature will work.",GOPPROF-01
How t0 identify risks? The idea is to find as much as possible “What if” cases.,GOPPROF-01
"To identify risks talk to different people — from management, tech, finance, etc.",GOPPROF-01
"Think over how you will measure the success and failures of your features. Also, it is desirable to mention the customer’s interaction with the product and its features.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
Cross-team collaboration is critical when creating successful projects. It is recommended to outline any questions or issues that may arise over time. Specify any valuable information to help the team understand how the product may evolve in the future.,GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Since product requirements are not necessary for the sake of the requirements themselves, they should be:",GOPPROF-01
And a few more tips to follow:,GOPPROF-01
"You may endlessly describe what to do and how to do it. Of course, it would be great to find one universal PRD template that would be used regardless of the project’s nature and conditions. As you can see, that’s tricky given that software products development roadmap may differ significantly, due to a wide range of product features. Thus, the PRD template will differ in different projects and depends on the approach to project implementation.",GOPPROF-01

"Kör is an online platform in Norway that allows booking driving programs & lessons online. It keeps track of user’s private practice driving and lets family & friends be involved in the process. As a number of other projects for our clients, Kör went through the Discovery phase with Fulcrum and got a detailed PRD.",GOPPROF-01
Buff is a popular loyalty program for gamers. It rewards gamers just for playing. Right now the platform has 200K users worldwide.,GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"BUFF mobile app PRD included all the critical components listed above. The main challenge was to solve was the integration with the games we support. On the PC app, the service is provided by Overwolf. On mobile, we needed to come with our tracking solution.",GOPPROF-01
We developed BUFF as a bundle of separate React applications which work in synergy with each other communicating via EventBus pattern.,GOPPROF-01

"Product development is one of the riskiest business tasks. In a 2018 analysis, Harvard Business School discovered that 30,000 new products come to market every year--and 95% of these products fail.",GOPPROF-01
"Yet, without products, most businesses can't exist at all. How can savvy entrepreneurs mitigate this risk? ",GOPPROF-01
"Planning experts note recurring product development problems. These issues consistently contribute to product failure, regardless of industry. These include:",GOPPROF-01
"Fortunately, you can solve all of these problems with one solution: an evidence-based product development process. A company increases its odds of product success when it standardizes its product development process. ",GOPPROF-01
"Critically, a business needs to use accurate data to establish this process. One useful information-synthesis sheet is a Product Requirements Document (PRD). As your business organizes a product development method, a PRD empowers you to standardize and streamline. ",GOPPROF-01
"A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is a single-page record. It articulates a team's goals and purpose for a product under development. It also includes elements that streamline the product development process, while maintaining a degree of agility. ",GOPPROF-01
"Engineers, designers, and developers in an array of industries use PRDs--including those in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NASA calls requirements ""the necessary functions and features"" of a product or apparatus.",GOPPROF-01
An effective PRD empowers a development team to define a proposed product's functions and features. The team determines these elements through an agile product development process.,GOPPROF-01
"Within this process, the PRD is an iterative document. Developers continually define and refine the product's requirements as they adapt to market changes.",GOPPROF-01
A useful PRD cultivates a shared understanding of a product's purpose. All development and marketing team members stay on the same page when they work from the PRD.,GOPPROF-01
"An iterative PRD can also break developers away from the linear-thinking trap. The document is designed to start lean, then grow throughout the process. Developers keep adaptability at the forefront when growth is built into the document. ",GOPPROF-01
"Finally, a PRD empowers teams to plan effectively for the development process. To write the document, engineers must identify requirements for resources that empower flexibility. So, the developers gather data about the market, resources, and current technological capacities.",GOPPROF-01
"When the team undertakes PRD-writing, it prepares them to develop products with agility. This process alone makes PRD valuable.  ",GOPPROF-01
"Think about the PRD as a solution, not a map. This document clarifies what the product will be, how it will work, and what problems the product will solve.",GOPPROF-01
"The PRD does not spell out how to fund, design, manufacture, or distribute the product. It is better to make these decisions after the team finalizes the PRD.",GOPPROF-01
"So far, we've established why a PRD is a useful tool that can mitigate the risk of product failure. To recap, a good PRD:",GOPPROF-01
"Effective PRDs do this by conveying critical information to developers in a single, concise document. To write a useful PRD, a developer needs to incorporate six critical sets of information. ",GOPPROF-01
The document must answer core questions about the process. Answer questions like:,GOPPROF-01
"The PRD relays process and status information in 1-2 sentences. Alternately, the writer might present this information in a box or chart at the top of the page.  ",GOPPROF-01
The PRD states the purpose of your product's release. It also notes how this goal feeds into broader company goals. You might derive this summary from the third information set.,GOPPROF-01
The PRD relates the product's value proposition. Developers glean this information from market research.,GOPPROF-01
The PRD writer might use a Marketing Requirements Document (MRD) to develop this information set. The research answers questions like:,GOPPROF-01
"Writers might answer these questions using a context diagram. You can also relate this information with a flow map, one-sentence summaries, or a bullet-point synopsis in the PRD. ",GOPPROF-01
The PRD defines what success is for the product. Express a vision of success from the user's perspective (i.e. the product solves the customer's problem successfully). Indicate how to recognize the product's success in the market.,GOPPROF-01
"The PRD also defines metrics. It describes how to measure the product's success in different use cases. The PRD writer might also note how successful competing products are by these metrics, and how your company's existing solutions measure up.",GOPPROF-01
The bulkiest data set conveys the product's intended components and their respective functions. It also describes proposed design elements.,GOPPROF-01
"In this section, the writer often notes how each element contributes to the product's aesthetic and user interface. In the same vein, this PRD segment conveys how each part impacts user experience.",GOPPROF-01
"The initial, lean PRD draft does not include specification minutia. Instead, engineers can use this draft section to design mockups and prototypes.",GOPPROF-01
The PRD summarizes potential users' current problems. This includes pain points users experience with current solutions.,GOPPROF-01
These problems drive the company's approach to further user experience research. Team members can revise this section of the PRD as they learn more about the qualities of the customer's experience.,GOPPROF-01
"Remember: the first draft is a lean document. The PRD is not the place to detail exactly how the product solves the user's problems. It merely identifies the users' problems, then notes them in plain language. ",GOPPROF-01
"If you are in the pre-development stage, your company will get more out of an MRD than a PRD. The fundamental PRD meaning, ""product requirements document,"" indicates that the report describes a future product. ",GOPPROF-01
"In the pre-development stage, you don't yet have a preliminary concept or product proposal. To generate useful product concepts, you must analyze the market. ",GOPPROF-01
"As market analysts research the current state of your industry, they might compile a Market Requirements Document (MRD). The MRD answers questions like:",GOPPROF-01
The MRD primarily relates information about the market. It only touches lightly on product-centered questions. Marketing analysts typically aren't product developers.,GOPPROF-01
"Developers and engineers can use the MRD to jumpstart product ideation. As they move from ideas to concepts, they can begin the product development process--and write a PRD.",GOPPROF-01
"It's smart to start with a lean, one-page PRD. A concise first draft enables clarity and focus.",GOPPROF-01
Developers can easily move from one step of the process to the next with an uncluttered vision of their end goal. Your team can create a PRD in eight steps. ,GOPPROF-01
"First, enable collaboration. Set up the PRD in a place all relevant team members can access it easily. Developers, engineers, marking, and sales team members will all benefit if they can easily reference the document.",GOPPROF-01
"To set the stage for iterations, use a document platform that makes it easy to create variants. The ideal document location lets approved team members edit the document as they go.",GOPPROF-01
"The program may also empower questions, comments, or suggestions. These options can improve collaboration. You can choose from a multitude of shared document programs to create the PRD, including:",GOPPROF-01
"These programs all offer cloud document storage, and each enables invitation-only collaboration. Some are free, while others require a monthly paid subscription. ",GOPPROF-01
"After choosing a document program, the PRD writers should choose a structure. The PRD writers might design their own format. Or, they may decide to start from a template.",GOPPROF-01
"There's no standard PRD document structure. So, choose a structure that conveys information clearly and suits your brand's aesthetic. Make sure the format can relate to the six information sets.  ",GOPPROF-01
Summarize the purpose of the product. Make sure everyone is on the same page about the purpose before you write it down.,GOPPROF-01
"Then, articulate the product's goals precisely. At this stage, establish which metrics you'll use to measure how well the product meets its goal. Consider diverse metrics. ",GOPPROF-01
"As you hone in on the product's purpose, talk about the relevant background and market information. Note your assumptions about users inherent in your product goals. Include these notes in the PRD.",GOPPROF-01
"Engineers, developers, and market analysts should collaborate at this stage. Use the MRD and established product goals to conceptualize the product's components. ",GOPPROF-01
"Ascertain how each feature might look, function, and impact the user experience. Note all the assumptions built into these concepts.",GOPPROF-01
"Summarize the features and functions. But, don't delineate the components' specs at this stage. ",GOPPROF-01
"After you've established the product's goals and conceptualized its features, it's time to set release requirements. Release requirements answer one question: what is the minimum viable product?",GOPPROF-01
What must features must the product prototype have to be useable? These are the prototype requirements.,GOPPROF-01
"When you reach these, you're at the stage in the product development process that lets you run initial user tests. Then you can get user feedback and revise the product. ",GOPPROF-01
"Then, discuss which additional features are mandatory for wide release. Record both the prototype requirements and the release requirements in the PRD.  ",GOPPROF-01
"With the end goal in sight, work backward to create a timeline. As you work, identify constraints and pre-requisites. Pre-requisites drive the order of events; these are tasks that you can only begin when a specific prior task is complete.",GOPPROF-01
"Your team can do some tasks simultaneously. But, be aware of time and budget constraints. Develop the timeline based on the length of time tasks take, not a pre-determined date. ",GOPPROF-01
"After you create the timeline, take a step back. What questions does your team still need to answer? This might be information about the customer's persona, their problems, or general market questions. ",GOPPROF-01
"As you answer these questions throughout the process, connect this information to the PRD. Use the footer to note resources in other documents. Or, create an ""Additional Resources"" page. ",GOPPROF-01
"You've created the PRD draft. Now, share the document with stakeholders. Solicit their feedback.",GOPPROF-01
Stakeholder feedback drives iterations. Let the document grow and change. ,GOPPROF-01
"Companies use PRDs internally. So, there's no single standard document format, even within a single industry.",GOPPROF-01
"But, you can examine a Product Requirements Document example from a few different sources. Any of these might inspire a format that works for your company.",GOPPROF-01
"In the United States, government departments mandate specific requirements documents if a business wants to submit its product for approval. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) offers this template.",GOPPROF-01
"Note that HUD calls this a Functional Requirements Document (FRD). This is longer and more detailed than the initial, single-page PRD.",GOPPROF-01
"It encompasses security assessments and an environmental impact report, which are HUD-specific. These reports are not part of most PRDs.  ",GOPPROF-01
"The Massachusetts Institute of Technology publishes free educational resources. In this publication, The Fundamentals of System Engineering, Dr. Olivier de Weck explains product development methods. Within this booklet, Weck:",GOPPROF-01
"MIT's free resources empower many developers. Another MIT resource is this simple Product Requirements Document template. While it is software-specific, you can easily adapt it to address concerns relevant to your industry. ",GOPPROF-01
"At Niezek, we've mastered the art of product development. We'll take your Product Requirements Document and jumpstart the build process.",GOPPROF-01

"A PRD is one of the methods we use for creating apps and other digital products - we’ve found it’s a useful, central point for bringing technology-minded developers and business-focused team members together. ",GOPPROF-01
If you’re still not sure about using a PRD or what they should include - here’s everything you need to know!,GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"A product requirements document (PRD) covers the necessities of a given product or feature, as well as the objectives, values, and capabilities that need to be met/established. It is one of the more popular tools and methods for project forming and scope definition - in other words, it defines the requirements for all involved.",GOPPROF-01
"In simpler terms, it’s the project’s core documentation. Its size can be as short or as long as it is needed - what’s important is that it’s formatted correctly. ",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
Here are the essential elements that need to be included:,GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"At the core of any product requirement document are goals and objectives. For the latter, you should start by explaining why the product is being built - what is it meant to achieve? ",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
Key objective details include:,GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Goals list and description: Goals, on the other hand, introduce the vital stepping stones to finalizing the project. While releasing the product is a goal in itself, the PRD will define various stages along the way, which will be realistic, actionable, achievable, and measurable. In other words, they are well defined, practical, and have clear criteria to define when they’re done. ",GOPPROF-01
"Product Time Frame: When will the product be released? A longer time frame will result in higher costs and a highly-customized product arguably needs more time. Setting a time frame will enable you to make these decisions, if necessary. ",GOPPROF-01
"Goal Time Frame: Each goal should have its timeframe. The goals must have a clear order so that the PRD is able to define how work proceeds once the project starts. Just like the overall objectives, it should be noted that longer tasks lead to higher costs. Breaking down goals this way identifies where these costs are best spent.",GOPPROF-01
"Success Metrics: How will you define the goal as achieved? How will it be tested or measured to ensure it passes this criteria? How will you measure the success of the product? This ties into the overall business objective. Do you want to engage with as many users as possible, generate a set amount of revenue, or even revenue per user? It all depends on the product/service.",GOPPROF-01
"Users / Personas: In other words, the target audience. Who are you building this? Knowing this will help ensure a user-centric design later on.",GOPPROF-01
"Reasoning: There should be a “why?” for every product. Why are you building it? What problems are you solving? More than just the users and personas, the PRD needs to define the very reason and purpose the product is looking to fulfill. Every subsequent choice or decision should ultimately match this factor.",GOPPROF-01
"Vision: Here, you can define the vision for the overall project. However, it’s worth being careful here. Often, we want to focus on the core MVP release, but nonetheless ensure the groundwork is in place for any known expansions planned - but most of this detail can be saved for the “Future Work” section.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"While the release date can be mentioned in the above, the exact specifications of the release also need to be defined. It’s important to note that your product might have multiple releases, such as moving from an MVP to a fully scoped project. This is where the roadmap for that is outlined.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
A basic release should include:,GOPPROF-01
"Release name: In case of multiple updates, this ensures we know which version is which.",GOPPROF-01
Release date: very self-explanatory. The date this specific release goes live.,GOPPROF-01
Features: what key features are included in this specific release.,GOPPROF-01
"Dependencies: anything that this release is dependent on, such as third party support. Products may gain more or fewer dependencies as they evolve.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Every product is made of numerous features, the number of which will depend on the scope and scale of your project. In this part, we define everything we have planned and prepared for each respective aspect. For each feature, the PRD also needs to define the following:",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Feature name: Every feature needs a name. It seems simple, but ensuring naming terminology is followed will remove confusion later on, and the PRD is the first official place to set these names.",GOPPROF-01
"Description: What it does. In other words, the function of the feature. ",GOPPROF-01
"Purpose: Why is this feature included? This is where we list the intended outcome of the feature, in regards to how we want the user to engage with it.",GOPPROF-01
"User’s Problem: If we want the feature to have a purpose, it needs to meet a problem (or want) that the user has. Here we define what that is.",GOPPROF-01
"User Value: If we have the problem defined, then we need to also establish the intended value. How does this solution help the user in regard to his or her initial problem?",GOPPROF-01
"Specific Assumptions: There’s a section of assumptions as a whole, which we’ll get to soon, but for each feature, we can list any specific assumptions that have been made.",GOPPROF-01
"Out of Scope Aspects: If there’s anything that’s out of the current scope (for example, it’s not part of the initial MVP or release), it should be defined here, so the team knows not to work on it.",GOPPROF-01
"Acceptance Criteria: In any project - but especially in agile strategies where teams work on features independently - we need to determine what is ‘done’. Acceptance criteria are how we measure this. If the feature’s current versioning doesn’t match the acceptance criteria, it’s a clear measure that more work needs to be done.",GOPPROF-01
"Risk: Every project has its risks and these need to be assessed and documented. Such risks can include new technologies (which will need testing) or integrations with existing products, among other unique factors.",GOPPROF-01
"Cost: The total cost of any project is essential - even at the start, a calculated estimate is vital for approving, planning, and ultimately moving forward. Given that many of the details listed above describe the time needed, we can already give an estimate of the most typical cost: man-hours. Any cost estimation, whether its a fixed price or a time and materials model, needs to know how many hours (for each type of role) are required. ",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"In this section, we need to define how the overall user workflow will work. We want to understand how users will enter the app or service, what they will view on each screen, and how they will ultimately navigate throughout. This helps put the above features in their place amongst the final product.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Typically, the more developed UX aspects are often down after the PRD, but they can sometimes be done before, too. Either way, the wireframes and flow diagrams should be included here as soon as they are available.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"A key part of product design is understanding the environment in which it will be run. From a technical standpoint, this involves the devices and systems the target users (defined previously) will use.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"At this stage, we need to include all available (but not assumed) information available. For example, if we know which devices we are targeting, we can conclude which operating systems and browsers we need to design for. If we have the research on our specific niche, we may also have information on memory, processing power and other capabilities (this isn’t a problem on iOS but, given the broad Android and PC market, is something that needs to be considered).",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"However, when it comes to what is not known, this should be saved for the assumptions. For example, we can assume our users will have internet access because they are using their phones, but we don’t know how reliable or how consistent this connection is.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Once released, every organization needs a way to determine the success of the overall application. This is very similar to how every feature needs a purpose; it’s how we measure if it worked or not.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"The success metrics can take many forms, but often involves the number of downloads, the number of purchases made-in app or even advertising revenue (in the case of a free app, for example). ",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Such metrics will also be used to chart initial success and growth. A social network app might focus on users first, while an e-commerce app may focus on initial sales. Based on your required ROI or initial objectives, an exact number may be needed.(This also applies to internal solutions too - for instance, does the new solution save time or improve performance over the last tool by a noticeable margin?)",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Likewise, when it comes to analytics, this is where we also note all of the metrics that will be analyzed, in order to anticipate success or failures. Such performance metrics can include:",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
Percentage of users who interact with each feature,GOPPROF-01
Online reviews/feedback,GOPPROF-01
How long it takes users to move to the desired goal or action,GOPPROF-01
How often users utilize each feature,GOPPROF-01
How long users spend in the application,GOPPROF-01
How users navigate (vs what was intended),GOPPROF-01
Abandonment rates - how many users simply stop coming back to the app.,GOPPROF-01
Recommendations,GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Most products will have some initial scope layed out for future expansion. Here, we can detail these roadmaps so that every team is aware of the current plans regarding how the solution may evolve or adapt.",GOPPROF-01
"For each function or feature, we should always include some basic information, even at the earliest stages:",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Feature or Function: basically, what it is that we’re considering to include.",GOPPROF-01
Purpose: why we want to include this,GOPPROF-01
Priority: how important this feature is business plans or objectives,GOPPROF-01
"Time Frame: how much we estimate this will take, or how urgently is it needed.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Earlier, we mentioned assumptions, constraints, and dependencies at various points. While these should be detailed at each respective point, they also need their section. This is so everyone involved knows what these overall limiting factors are.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Assumptions include anything that we predict to be available, but we cannot currently guarantee. For example, earlier we mentioned assuming users have a strong internet connection.",GOPPROF-01
"Constraints on the other hand, detail hurdles that can’t be overcome or, in other words, options that are off the table. This can include budget constraints, but also technical choices and options. For example, if the project needs to be compatible with other systems, this will limit various technology options and needed to be made clear here.",GOPPROF-01
"Dependencies: refer to third-party services, solutions, or items that our project will rely on. We depend on them, but can’t control them. Good examples here include GIS systems, which need to rely on various third party options (like Google Maps, public data, or satellite imagery).",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"One of the strongest benefits of Project Requirement Documentation is in cross-team projects. It’s a centralized document designed to keep all teams informed through clear and transparent objectives and necessities. If everyone sticks to the PRD, one team won’t make choices or implementations that cause problems for anyone else.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Furthermore, the PRD can also form part of the project backlog as it already contains the objectives, requirements, and scope of the work. The PRD can be separated into project tasks or maintained in the Project Information section.",GOPPROF-01
"However, it’s also especially useful in Agile project management. There are many Agile systems, such as Scrum and Kanban, and while the specifics may differ, there are always a few things in common.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Agile is iterative. Rather than focus on one release that takes a lot of time, Agile splits work into sub-teams for each functionality. A PRD is essential here, as it gives every team a core document to refer to, ensuring their work stays within the outlined scope.",GOPPROF-01
"Agile is adaptive. The biggest benefit of Agile is that it’s focused on smaller releases means that it can adapt should problems arise. While this might at first seem like a challenge for PRDs, the two go together surprisingly well. The PRD outlines the business objectives and users, which means new decisions have something to check or validate themselves against. What’s more, this central document can be updated for all teams, as well, once any such adoptions are final. ",GOPPROF-01
"Agile is about prioritization. In nearly all projects, there aren’t enough developers to do everything at once. Instead, the core functionalities are focused on first. Because the PRD can explore each functionality in terms of priority (among other things), Agile teams know what to focus on next",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"The PRD is particularly useful for Agile Project Managers. These individuals are typically tasked with creating the product in line with the Product Owners initial scope and requirements (but more on their involvement later). Thankfully, the PRD details everything agreed between the PM and the PO. It’s a checksheet the PM can use to ensure nothing goes off track, enabling them to better manage Agile teams without losing sight of the ultimate objective.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"When we said that a PRD is a great cross-team tool, we mean every team. Outside of development, the PRD defines details that can be used by those involved both before and after the product’s creation.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Sales and marketing can use the document to understand the intended users, the app’s core advantages, and how to combine the two.",GOPPROF-01
"UI/UX Designers can add their input in terms of users, as well as contribute user flows and other designs based on the detailed scope.",GOPPROF-01
"Support teams can understand the functionalities of the app and plan support strategies for each aspect, as well as those added in the future.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"We’ve already covered why the PRD is great for Project Managers, but what about Product Owners?",GOPPROF-01
"The POs role is to oversee the project at the highest level. They may come from the organization commissioning the app, the commissioning party. In any case, they are the person directly responsible for the final product. While the PM focuses on active work, it’s the PO that looks at the backlog, checks current progress, and otherwise ensures the project is staying on track.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Here, the Project Requirements Document’s role lies in defining the problem and the expectations of the final product. This is an important way to view any project; by understanding the initial problem that the software is a solution too, a Product Owner can always keep a core focus on what’s important.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"It contains everything the Product Owner needs - in part because they often have the final say on a lot of the overarching criteria. As such, the PO can use the PRD to prioritize backlog items, approve or disapprove any new plans, and otherwise compare any work done with the intended output.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"For the teams closest to the project’s development and implementation, a PRD can also offer a lot of use. ",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Alongside this, the PRD includes every functionality or feature, which helps in regards to Agile development. Teams can hand-off individual functions, as the document details the initial problem, how it is intended to be solved, and even acceptance criteria. ",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Furthermore, both Project Managers and their respective teams can use the PRD for guidance at all stages. As mentioned earlier, it can form the basis for the backlog, due to its task and criteria documentation. ",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"As an extra benefit, new teams can also use the PRD for onboarding documentation, as it lists technology choices, user flows, and all the vital background information needed to familiarize with a project.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"So, now we know how the PRD fits into various respective roles, what are the overall advantages of using a Product Requirements Document?",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Whenever decisions need to be made, the PRD is the core criteria to be compared against. Any decisions that don’t fit the PRD need to either be discussed or abandoned - it’s a clear flag that the project would be moving out of the initial scope of intentions.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"This is especially important when it comes to projects with strict technical specifications. A central document doesn’t just list which technologies have been chosen, it also lists why, as well as any other constraints or dependencies. ",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"As we’ve already covered, Agile development has a very rapid pace, focusing on smaller teams and releases. As such, these teams need a document that can always be referred to. Because a PRD includes all necessary data, this is perfect. It also focuses down on functionalities, users, and other respective criteria, so teams can find exactly what they need without having to make assumptions or blind decisions.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Different people view a project differently. Some, such as Project Managers and Product Owners, need a complete view, while respective teams need to focus on essential functionalities or factors.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Again we can also consider the PRD as a backlog, as it breaks the project up into essential work operations that can be checklisted against.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"With a PRD, all of this possible. The breakdown can be as detailed or niche as it needs to be, without the need for multiple documents or a wider information system. It keeps everything in one place for consistency but offers scalability that few other solutions provide.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"After all this, you might think that creating Product Requirements can be a difficult process - but it’s not!",GOPPROF-01
"We know this because it’s one of the main reasons we use PRDs in our projects. Not only to do they bring plenty of benefits, but they’re also easy to set-up and establish. After all, we only require the essential information that every product needs, anyway:",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
Objectives and Goals: Why does the business need this app and what does it need to achieve?,GOPPROF-01
"Features: What individual features will the app have? Essentially, we’re breaking down the app’s purpose into individual steps/components.",GOPPROF-01
Use Cases & User Stories: Who are the users? Why would they use this app and how does it solve their problem?,GOPPROF-01
Acceptance Criteria: What will deem the product (and each feature) as a success.,GOPPROF-01
"Project Parameters: The cost, time, quality, and risk of choices made.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"If you weren’t collecting this information during the initial phase, you really should! The PRD only asks for essential data.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Other than this, it’s essential to get the main features list details correctly. Each feature needs to stand up as a document in its own right. This will greatly aid in development, as teams can jump straight to all the information they need.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
We always make sure to include:,GOPPROF-01
"Context: Why does this feature exist and how does it integrate with the wider solution, such as other technology constraints?",GOPPROF-01
Use Cases & User Stories: Why would a user need this and how will this feature solve this need?,GOPPROF-01
Acceptance Criteria: How will this specific function be labeled as ‘done’. How will its performance or success be measured once it’s ready?,GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"Include all of this and you’ll find the PRD document not only centralizes information but also saves time and ensures people are brought on and updated with ease! You’ll notice how easy it is when everyone can refer to the same documentation - no mistakes, no miscommunication, and no choices made that move away from the project’s goals!",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"A Product Requirements Document is one of the best ways to provide a centralized resource of everything the project needs, from technical choices to user problems being addressed. Because of its ability to scale both up and down, it’s a vital document for agile development, giving every team across the project all the information they need for their respective tasks. It’s why we use it!",GOPPROF-01

Rating,GOPPROF-01
"To create a successful product, it’s essential to follow all the necessary steps from the very beginning. To make sure that no time will be wasted on misunderstandings, you might want to write a product requirements document. There are many examples online; however, it can be too easy to get lost in different options. In this article, we will go through all the aspects of creating a PRD so that you’ll ✓learn what should be included, ✓review what specifications exist, and ✓be perfectly able to create your own PRD template.",GOPPROF-01
"The PRD document is an initial one, the starting point in the process of developing your new product. Basically, it describes all the features, specifications, and functionality of a product, and also declares the conditions and stages for design and development. Writing a good PRD is similar to the place where the marathon of creation begins. The better you explain the rules before the race starts, the better the chance that everything goes smoothly and correctly.",GOPPROF-01
"In PRD, you gather all the essential details needed for the process of development. You also mention goals and objectives, as well as expected results of each stage of work, the time required for the development of MVP, and any additional technical details that might be of help when the actual work begins. Remember that this is not a list of dream descriptions, but a technical document based on research and extensive analysis with the main goal to minimize the risk of misunderstandings, and the necessity of implementing changes due to those misunderstandings.",GOPPROF-01
,GOPPROF-01
"The detailed and effective PRD Product Requirement Document takes time to create. Sometimes, it also takes money, as technical specifications might require additional expertise from the outside.",GOPPROF-01
"Let’s look at the pros of PRD, first:",GOPPROF-01
"On the other hand, there are a couple of disadvantages:",GOPPROF-01
"To eliminate these disadvantages, there is an alternative – agile development done in sprints (called iterations). This is based on a number of principles and allows you to start the process almost at the moment the idea appears in your head. In this case, you will have to participate in the development and control of the process. Your project will be split into smaller tasks and be completed during these iterations, which usually take about two weeks.",GOPPROF-01
"In this case, you will:",GOPPROF-01
"Of course, there are also some cons that you might want to consider writing a PRD:",GOPPROF-01
"Based on the information above, if you know what you want and have a clear idea of how much time and money you want to spend on it, creating a product requirements specification in advance might still be a more suitable option.",GOPPROF-01
,GOPPROF-01
"Here we consider essential PRD requirements. First of all, let’s remember the goal of the document – to communicate the concept of the product under development and arrange all the details that are useful for the development process. Long story short, all the technical specifications included in the document ensure that the future product will be compliant with all requirements. These tips will give you a quick understanding of how to write a good PRD for your development team:",GOPPROF-01
"In the next section of this article, we continue learning about how to write a product requirements document, and you will see a sample outline for it.",GOPPROF-01
,GOPPROF-01
"Now we are going to go through the components of a well-developed product requirements document template that can be used as a template. Once you understand the idea behind each section, you will have no problem looking at it from an experienced product management specialist’s point of view while creating your own docs. Here are the essential components of a product requirements template, which may still be somewhat flexible in sequence, depending on what business you have or other factors:",GOPPROF-01
,GOPPROF-01
This section provides a general idea of the future product and explains why it should be developed in the first place. It helps to set the team on the right track from the very beginning of the project.,GOPPROF-01
"Here, you’ll answer general questions such as:",GOPPROF-01
"These are just samples of questions that can be used as a PRD example. Depending on your ideas, you can exclude some or add more. Basically, this section of a PRD is a high-level description of everything concerning the future project.",GOPPROF-01
,GOPPROF-01
"Before going into more detail about the product, you need to establish and describe your target audience. It might be hypothetical, but detailed enough so that the reader can imagine the user. The most simple and pleasant way is to start with these characteristics: age of potential clients, their genders, possible occupations, levels of education, and geographical locations.",GOPPROF-01
"To create a valuable product right from the start, you need to answer the who-what-when-how questions regarding your customers. The main idea here might be shaped as the ability to see the future product through the eyes of those who might use it.",GOPPROF-01
"Also, mention the needs that are to be met with the product. For example:",GOPPROF-01
Need/problem: The user needs the opportunity to pay for the item with bitcoins.,GOPPROF-01
"Solution: The user can launch an app, tie it to the wallet, and pay directly.",GOPPROF-01
,GOPPROF-01
"Here, you should have a detailed description of all the pages of the website or the screens of the application. Start with analyzing the needs of the audience described in the previous section, and base the components on their needs.",GOPPROF-01
"As a sample, if you build an eCommerce web project, you need to build a detailed sitemap.",GOPPROF-01
It should include:,GOPPROF-01
It is appropriate to include some graphs in the sample PRD that would show the connection between components and suggest possible user flaws.,GOPPROF-01
,GOPPROF-01
"This section should describe the features that will be included in the product in different stages. No need to describe all the tiny details, just provide the team with a general understanding of the features you plan to start with, and what features you’d like to add later.",GOPPROF-01
"For our Product Requirements Document example, let’s imagine that you want to start with a three-page website that includes a page with five items for sale; however, in the future, you want to increase the number of goods you sell as well as add a blog and interactive color-matching assistant. You need to include your plans in the document, as those who build the website will need to establish a foundation that can keep up with the growing number of features.",GOPPROF-01
,GOPPROF-01
This part is about all the ‘additional’ requirements that are different from those that are purely functional. Communicate these special product requirements in the best possible way.,GOPPROF-01
Here are some questions that might get you on the right track:,GOPPROF-01
,GOPPROF-01
"This section is optional and good to have. Basically, wireframes are the layouts of pages that give the general outline of elements and features on the page. No need to include fonts, logos, colors or other design elements, just the most basic information. If you have a general idea, just include it here. It can even be a hand-drawing.",GOPPROF-01
"For complicated products, this section might require hours of work from designers before approving the final version. Keep this in mind before trying to draw any complicated schemes.",GOPPROF-01
,GOPPROF-01
"If there are any potential risks, mention them here. The development team might try to tackle those segments of software that are risky in order to decrease the risk, or at least prevent you from investing too much of your money and time into something that might not be claimed after all.",GOPPROF-01
,GOPPROF-01
"Creating a sample Product Requirement Document, it’s important to mention that you might want to include a section about analytics. This will provide your team with an understanding of what metrics you’re planning to use to measure the success of the project.",GOPPROF-01
"Creating this section, you may want to keep in mind your marketing department. What metrics are important for their work? For eCommerce projects, it would be the conversion rate. Inform the team what is needed so that it can be implemented early.",GOPPROF-01
"In this section, we will show you some samples of well-written Product Requirements Documents. First of all, it is worth mentioning that you can have your PRD in any size. Meaning that most of the samples online will start from one-page-fit-it-all PRD and end up with documents of 3-5 and up to 10 pages or more. We will take a closer look at each of those variations going from small to large.",GOPPROF-01
"As you can see from the example below, it is a well-designed one-page product requirements document. You may use this sample as a template to explore what elements should be, or maybe, included in your one-page PRD. Also, based on this example we can see the main benefits of having a smaller PRD.",GOPPROF-01
"First of all, it saves you, and everyone else, the time learning about the product since all the key information is presented in a concise manner.",GOPPROF-01
"Secondly, short PRD gives more space for change. It is much easier to cut a piece or replace it. Plus, surprisingly, smaller size leaves more space for creativity, there is no need to follow the same standard format as you’d have to with a bigger PRD. Overall, a one-page document can fit exactly as much context as you need to explain your product in simple terms.",GOPPROF-01
,GOPPROF-01
"Here we have another example of a product requirements document, but this time it is a much simpler looking sample. Although it looks uncomplicated, it is the very reason it is the one to choose. The accent on simplicity will only underline the actual message of the document.",GOPPROF-01
,GOPPROF-01
"This PRD product requirements document template is basically made design-free, which makes you look straight at the listed facts. Such a layout also leaves you with no choice but to be concise and consistent in your language. This PRD style can offer only necessary information, which is already fully completed and doesn’t require any additional explanation, meanwhile, it hasn’t got much room for any other interpretation.",GOPPROF-01
"There are also options to have your product requirements document template Word several pages long; as we can see from our next example which is 5 pages long. Considering how to write a PRD, it’s worth mentioning that it normally includes a full-body text, starting with a proper introduction of your product and a breakdown of the PRD components mentioned above.",GOPPROF-01
,GOPPROF-01
"Finally, in case your product requires more space for explanations, you can have a PRD document template up to 10 pages. As this sample shows, it is much better to start your PRD with a table of contents to map your way through. Larger PRDs should offer not just a full description of all the components but also break them down into subcategories, explaining all the work done in detail. Such product requirements documents give you enough space to depict and highlight any special part of your product, so there are no questions left unanswered.",GOPPROF-01

"A product requirements document (PRD) defines the requirements of a product, including the value and purpose of a product or feature. PRDs are written by the product manager to communicate what you are building, who it is for, and how it benefits the end user. It is often confused with a market requirements document (MRD), but they are different. An MRD should be created before a PRD so you can document what the customer needs and wants from your product or service before you define the requirements.",GOPPROF-01
Your PRD should follow a top-down approach that starts with the overall vision of what you want to accomplish. It should then tie product goals and initiatives with the features required to achieve that vision. A well-defined PRD also includes details about how the end user will interact with the functionality and what it will look like.,GOPPROF-01
"Many people associate PRDs with the waterfall development methodology. In waterfall, requirements are defined in the first phase of the project and provide a detailed description of what will be built. In recent years, agile development has shifted organizations towards using a more adaptive planning approach. This means requirements are continuously added to the backlog and prioritized based on importance.",GOPPROF-01
"No matter if you follow waterfall or agile methodologies, a PRD can be useful — helping to get everyone aligned around the key capabilities that will be delivered in a new product or release. This allows engineering, design, support, sales, and marketing teams to effectively collaborate and deliver a Complete Product Experience that delights customers.",GOPPROF-01
"PRDs should be clear and succinct. Today, many teams use purpose-built product management software to collaborate on a PRD and then define product work. Collaborating in real time and connecting your PRD to detailed work at the feature level saves you time from writing a new document for each release. If you are not yet ready to use a web-based tool to collaborate on your product plans, this guide provides a useful template to help you write a PRD.",GOPPROF-01
"Product requirements documents (PRDs) are often confused with market requirements documents (MRDs), but they are different. MRDs are documents that describe the size of your market, the types of customers you will target, and competitors in your space. PRDs describe how your product will actually be built. An MRD should be created before you write a PRD so you can document what the customer needs and wants from your product or service before you define the requirements.",GOPPROF-01
A product requirements document (PRD) template is a great way to capture information about your product requirements in one place — so everyone understands how the new features will solve customer problems and move the product strategy forward.,GOPPROF-01
The key components of a PRD include:,GOPPROF-01

,GOPPROF-01
"The objective section of a PRD explains the customer problem you are solving and how it relates to your vision, goals, and initiatives. This establishes the high-level purpose for what you want to accomplish and who your product is for. It also keeps the broader product team focused on building features that delight your customers — so you can deliver a Minimum Lovable Product (MLP).",GOPPROF-01
This template is a useful way to summarize your product strategy:,GOPPROF-01

Use the release section of the PRD to outline what will be delivered and when. This helps internal teams understand the scope and timeline of the release so they can plan their work. Capture key milestones and dependencies to keep everyone on track.,GOPPROF-01
Here is a template for capturing key information about a release:,GOPPROF-01

The next step is to define each feature (or user story) that will be delivered in the release. This section of the PRD is where you explain exactly what needs to be built so the development team can determine how best to implement it.,GOPPROF-01
Use this template to document the product requirements for each feature.,GOPPROF-01
Feature,GOPPROF-01
Name of the new feature or user story,GOPPROF-01
Description,GOPPROF-01
Description of what the new features or user stories will do,GOPPROF-01

Not doing,GOPPROF-01
Anything that is out of scope for this feature,GOPPROF-01
Acceptance criteria,GOPPROF-01
Conditions of acceptance,GOPPROF-01
Include visual wireframes and mockups in your PRD to show what the feature will look like and where it fits on the overall sitemap or page. This helps the development team understand exactly what you are envisioning and how the functionality should be implemented.,GOPPROF-01
Thinking about a feature from the perspective of what the user is trying to accomplish helps the team create a better overall experience in the development process. Wireframes are a great way to model how the user will interact with the functionality. Visualizing the customer journey in this way helps you identify ways to improve the overall experience and reduces misunderstandings about how features should work.,GOPPROF-01
It is important to establish upfront how you will measure the success of your features. Create a hypothesis about the impact you think a feature will have so you can assess whether it achieves the desired results.,GOPPROF-01
Here is a simple template you can use to develop a hypothesis for each feature in your PRD:,GOPPROF-01
We believe <this feature> will achieve <this outcome>.,GOPPROF-01
"Include an overall success metric to evaluate whether or not your hypothesis was correct. For example, here is a hypothesis for a feature in our demo product, Fredwin Cycling.",GOPPROF-01
We believe that supporting multiple languages will increase customer acquisition in international markets by 30 percent.,GOPPROF-01
Understanding customer behavior and what is working is key to building a product that delights your users. Work with engineering to put feature tracking in place in your application. This enables you to monitor key performance indicators so you can analyze how users are engaging with features and where further improvements might be needed.,GOPPROF-01
Here are some examples of performance indicators:,GOPPROF-01
Percent of users who interact with the feature,GOPPROF-01
How long it takes for people to interact with the feature for the first time,GOPPROF-01
How often each feature is being used,GOPPROF-01
How long users spend interacting with the feature,GOPPROF-01
How users navigate through important workflows,GOPPROF-01

"As you write your PRD, remember that the purpose of the document is to get everyone aligned so that they can understand how the product or feature works. Share the PRD with business and technical teams who help build, launch, and market your product so you can move forward in the same direction.",GOPPROF-01
"From ideation to launch, better product development happens with Aha! — try it free for 30 days.",GOPPROF-01
"A product requirements document (PRD) is a document containing all the requirements to a certain product.
It is written to allow people to understand what a product should do. A PRD should, however, generally avoid anticipating or defining how the product will do it in order to later allow interface designers and engineers to use their expertise to provide the optimal solution to the requirements.[citation needed]
",GOPPROF-01
"PRDs are most frequently written for software products, but can be used for any type of product and also for services. 
Typically, a PRD is created from a user's point-of-view by a user/client or a company's marketing department (in the latter case it may also be called Marketing Requirements Document (MRD)). The requirements are then analyzed by a (potential) maker/supplier from a more technical point of view, broken down and detailed in a Functional Specification (sometimes also called Technical Requirements Document).
",GOPPROF-01
"Typical components of a product requirements document (PRD) are:[citation needed]
",GOPPROF-01
"Not all PRDs have all of these components. In particular, PRDs for other types of products (manufactured goods, etc.) will eliminate the software-specific elements from the list above, and may add in additional elements that pertain to their domain, e.g. manufacturing requirements.
",GOPPROF-01
"Requirements documents are used to communicate the aims of a project in a clear, concise way to ensure all stakeholders are on the same page.",GOPPROF-01
When we talk about a requirements document we are often referring to a Business Requirements Document - or a BRD.,GOPPROF-01
"But as well as a BRD, there are 9 other types of requirements documents that a business may want to use while pushing a project through its stages of completion. The type of format to be used depends on the result of the project itself, whether it’s a product, service or system, and the particular requirements it has.",GOPPROF-01
"Before we jump into the 10 types of requirements documents, let's talk about the main people involved in their creation.",GOPPROF-01
​,GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
,GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
1. Business Requirements Document (BRD),GOPPROF-01
"Also known as a Business Needs Specification, a BRD is the first stage in a product life cycle. It details the problems that a product/service/system is trying to solve by logically listing high-level business requirements in relation to customers’ needs.",GOPPROF-01
"As well as non-negotiables, it also details features the project should provide, which can be interpreted as goals for the development team.",GOPPROF-01
It often includes:,GOPPROF-01
It’s normally a single page with a bullet-type list.,GOPPROF-01
A BRD is normally prepared by the project manager or business analyst.,GOPPROF-01
2. Functional Requirements Document (FRD),GOPPROF-01
"An FRD defines in logical terms, how a system or project will accomplish the requirements laid out in the BRD. It outlines the functionality of the system in detail by capturing the intended behaviour of the system, expressed as services, tasks or functions that the developers have agreed to provide.",GOPPROF-01
"Rather than define the ‘inner-workings’ and specifications, an FRD focuses on what users might observe when interacting with the system.",GOPPROF-01
"An example functional requirement might be: “When the user clicks the OK button, the dialog is closed and the user is returned to the main window in the state it was in before the dialog was displayed.""",GOPPROF-01
An FRD sometimes includes screen mockups or wireframes to illustrate the system’s design.,GOPPROF-01
"Depending on the complexity, FRDs can vary in length from 10 pages to several hundred.",GOPPROF-01
An FRD is normally written by the business analyst or systems analyst.,GOPPROF-01
3. Market Requirements Document (MRD),GOPPROF-01
"Sometimes referred to as a Marketing Requirements Document, an MRD focuses on the target market’s needs. It typically explains: What the product is, who the target customers are, what products are in competition with it and why customers are likely to want this product.",GOPPROF-01
An MRD typically includes:,GOPPROF-01
An MRD is normally prepared by the marketing manager or product manager.,GOPPROF-01
4. Product Requirements Document (PRD),GOPPROF-01
A PRD is used to communicate everything that must be included in a product release for it to be considered complete. It is written from a user’s point-of-view to understand what a product should do.,GOPPROF-01
"It usually includes the same content as an FRD, but with ‘non-functional requirements’ added. Although non-functional requirements are not related to the functionality of the product, it’s often important to identify them - they may include such needs as reliability, security and scalability.",GOPPROF-01
A typical PRD might contain:,GOPPROF-01
A PRD is normally prepared by the product manager.,GOPPROF-01
5. User Interface Requirements Document (UIRD),GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
A UIRD describes the look and feel of the User Interface (UI) of the system.,GOPPROF-01
It often defines:,GOPPROF-01
A UIRD more often than not includes mockup screenshots and wireframes to give readers an idea of what the finished system will look like.,GOPPROF-01
It’s written by the user interface design team.,GOPPROF-01
6. Technical Requirements Document (TRD),GOPPROF-01
"A TRD contains the software, hardware and platform requirements of the product. It includes requirements like the programming language the system should be developed in and the processor speed required to run the system.",GOPPROF-01
It might also consider the limitations of the system and its performance.,GOPPROF-01
A good TRD will include the following key items:,GOPPROF-01
A TRD is written by the engineering team.,GOPPROF-01
7. Quality Requirements Document,GOPPROF-01
"The quality requirements document outlines the expectations of the customer for the quality of the final product. It consists of various criteria, factors and metrics that must be satisfied.",GOPPROF-01
"Quality requirements might revolve around reliability, consistency, availability, usability, maintainability and customer experience.",GOPPROF-01
This document can be written by the project manager or business analyst,GOPPROF-01
8. Software Requirements Document or Software Requirements Specification (SRS),GOPPROF-01
An SRS outlines the features and the intended behaviour of a system. It describes the business’s understanding of the end user’s needs while laying out functional and nonfunctional requirements.,GOPPROF-01
An SRS is related to the FRD and PRD but written with a specific IT project in mind.,GOPPROF-01
Its contents may include:,GOPPROF-01
An SRS is normally compiled by the lead engineer of the project.,GOPPROF-01
9. Customer Requirements Document,GOPPROF-01
This is sometimes referred to as Client Requirement Document and it can refer to a PRD but for a specific customer or client.,GOPPROF-01

"Imagine you’re a chef at a high-end restaurant. One night, a very important customer comes in (let’s say Meryl Streep) and asks for pasta—but gives no other details. You panic. Sweat begins to gather beneath your toque blanche. If you disappoint Meryl Streep, you’ll be out of a job. But no one will tell you what kind of pasta she wants. ",GOPPROF-01
"This imagined scenario illustrates why a product requirements document is so important: It’s written by the product manager and details what needs to be built, who it’s for, and how it benefits the end user. It’s the difference between being told to cook pasta and being told to make spaghetti bolognese. ",GOPPROF-01
Learn what other benefits you can gain from creating a product requirements document and see how to get started.,GOPPROF-01
"A product requirements document completely defines the purpose of a product or feature and explains what the product should include. Without this very important document, your team is almost certain to fail because they have no idea what will be considered a successful build. ",GOPPROF-01
A PRD keeps everyone on the same page: No one should have any questions about what the product is or what it’s supposed to achieve after reading the PRD. It sets very clear goals and guidelines for a product and shows how the features of a product meet the user’s needs.,GOPPROF-01
There’s zero shame in getting a PRD confused with a BRD—there are way too many acronyms in the world. But a PRD is definitely different from other docs you may be more familiar with. ,GOPPROF-01
"A business requirements document positions the product in context of your organization as a whole. It describes what a new product should do and details the user’s needs and expectations, the reason this solution is necessary, and any constraints that could affect a successful deployment. It doesn’t go into specifications of the product or how it should look or act.",GOPPROF-01
"A software requirements document gets into the nuts-and-bolts of the software powering your product. It includes details on interfaces, safety requirements, functional capabilities, performance levels, and related information. These documents are meant for developers, testers, engineers, and clients.",GOPPROF-01
"The PRD is the vision for the product. Without a vision, what’s there to work towards? ",GOPPROF-01
"Product requirements documents also show how the product’s goals will be met with different aspects of the product. This document will be used by various teams in your company to help describe the product to stakeholders, help your sales team be able to pitch the product in a compelling way so that they can sell it and get rich, and your designers will know how it’s supposed to look and act. It is essentially a blueprint for your product.",GOPPROF-01
So do you need a PRD? Absolutely. Just as much as a car manufacturer needs a blueprint for a car before getting started on building it.,GOPPROF-01
"Because this document will touch design, support, sales, marketing, and engineering teams, there are a few items that are standard to include.",GOPPROF-01
"The key objective should explain who you are building the product for, what customer pain points you are hoping to solve, and how this product fits into your goals and vision as a company. This section could also include potential use cases.",GOPPROF-01
"Before beginning to craft your PRD document, it’s important that you gather the Voice of the Customer. Imagine you set about building a product without doing any customer research and it turned out that your customers wanted it to feel nothing like a social media app. You’re setting out to build a product that fills a need, so you need to know what those needs are. Once you understand what your customers want, you can then explain how your key objective for the product meets those desires.",GOPPROF-01
"You’ll likely have multiple release dates for various components or iterations of the product, especially if you’re using the agile methodology. In your PRD, you’ll detail deadlines for key components of the project. Once this is defined, project managers can start building out scopes and timelines and then placing those into sprints. ",GOPPROF-01
"Define the features of your product so people know what to build. Relating back to your key objectives, this section should detail what the purpose of each feature is and what problem it hopes to solve.",GOPPROF-01
"For example, let’s say you’re making a marketplace app for selling and purchasing clothes—you want to incorporate all the fun of social media with the excitement of scoring cool clothes for less. In your PRD, you’ll then have the description of what your home feed will look like and show how it meets the requirement of feeling like social media engagement. You may also then have a description of an item’s post with the original price contrasted with the “for sale” price and prove that it meets the requirement of scoring cool clothes for less money. In this way, each feature has a calculated purpose. ",GOPPROF-01
"You should also be able to detail how the user will interact with the app: Will it have an infinite scroll, will there be an embedded camera feature, and will there be a way to easily block problem users? This should all be defined in your PRD.",GOPPROF-01
"Your product requirements document should also include release criteria, goals you must hit before releasing the product. Create release criteria around:",GOPPROF-01
Consider tools such as a <strong>critical to quality tree</strong> to connect customer needs with product requirements.,GOPPROF-01
"Design is, obviously, visual. This is where you’ll want to incorporate wireframes of pages and mockups of designs to help others see what you’re imagining for the look and feel of the site.",GOPPROF-01
 ,GOPPROF-01
"If you haven’t set forth how the performance of your product will be determined, there’s no way to know if it’s a success or failure. Your product should have a feature tracker in place that determines which features of your product are being used most often to help gauge which components of your product are most successful. This type of tracking helps you improve your product in the future. Performance indicators could include how often each feature is used, how long your users spend interacting with features, how users navigate workflows, etc.",GOPPROF-01
"Quantify the success of each feature. For instance, you may say “We believe our Apple Pay integration will be used by 40% of users.” From that point forward, you have a numerical way to determine whether or not you were correct and whether or not the feature was a success. ",GOPPROF-01
"Use a hypothesis for each of your features, including a quantifiable hypothesis that can be revisited after launch to determine success or room for improvement. You may find that some features can be abandoned altogether.",GOPPROF-01
"The analytics above may help determine improvements in the future. But you may also have ideas for how you want the product to evolve over time. That future work should still have the customers’ needs in mind. In this section, it’s important to keep your ideas high level—you can get more granular in the future.",GOPPROF-01
"Thankfully, there are product requirements document templates that take the guesswork out of the process. Create a template from the information we've provided and customize it to your company's needs.",GOPPROF-01

Not so technical and need to know how to write a product requirements document? Here’s how to write a PRD with templates and examples.,GOPPROF-01
"Let’s say you’ve suddenly thought of your million-dollar idea in the middle of the night. You’re excited and can’t wait to begin, but you’re not sure what the next steps are.",GOPPROF-01
"In order to be “the next big thing,” you need to have a detailed vision, not just a great idea (although the great idea helps).",GOPPROF-01
"Not only that, you need to be able to clearly express your big idea to other people: the people who are going to invest in your idea and the people who are going to build it for you.",GOPPROF-01
"After researching what the next step is, you arrive at the conclusion that before you do anything, be it hiring a developer or fundraising, you need to know how to write a product requirements document (PRD).",GOPPROF-01
"A PRD, a quasi-combination of a business requirements document (BRD) and a systems requirements document (SRD), will help you explain to a developer what your vision is and what needs to happen for it to become a working product.",GOPPROF-01
"With a PRD in hand, your developer has a better sense of what your requirements are and how they can help you build what you’re looking for. By knowing in detail what you want, you can save yourself a lot of time and money.",GOPPROF-01

"Below, we’re going to go through the different sections of the Product Requirements Document. We’ll give you examples and fill them in as if we were the founder of SafePark, this parking spot locating app and website, as described earlier.",GOPPROF-01
"This describes the product you’re going to build, so you want to clearly describe the product’s purpose, features, and functionalities. ",GOPPROF-01
Here’s a sample product requirements document overview to use as a template:,GOPPROF-01
"From London to Chicago, Taipei to Rio De Janeiro, if you’ve ever lived in a big city, you know how hard finding parking can be.SafePark can fix this problem for urbanites around the world. SafePark is a freemium app and website that will locate open parking spots in cities all across the world.The free app will show you the unoccupied parking spot nearest to you (although it won’t show whether the spot is metered or free of charge) while the premium version will display the cost of the parking spot in 15-minute increments.SafePark will use the geolocation and GPS capabilities in your phone to show you where you can legally park and allows you to report to other users when a space becomes available. The website uses the same geolocation services as the mobile app but will show more possible locations because of the bigger screen size. When it’s released, SafePark will be the next revolution in urban living.",GOPPROF-01
"This description is a good PRD example of an overview because it describes the users’ pain points, why they need your product (difficulty finding parking in a big city), and shows how the product will solve their problems (helping users find parking).",GOPPROF-01
Our sample PRD overview discusses the product’s main features and functionalities: finding open parking through the user’s phone geolocation and GPS capabilities and crowdsourced user reports for open spots.,GOPPROF-01
"In other words, the overview clearly and concisely describes why the product is needed and what it will do.",GOPPROF-01

"This helps you answer who your audience is, what they can do with your product, when they might use your product, and how they will access it.",GOPPROF-01
Here’s how SafePark went about describing their target customers on their sample PRD:,GOPPROF-01
"Who: Car owners, aged 18-70, who live in major cities and need to find a parking spot.What: This app will allow users to find an unoccupied parking spot nearest to them using the GPS capabilities of their phone. They will also be able to report unoccupied spots (or to flag the spot they just left as unoccupied) after they leave.When: Urbanites who need parking spots will use this app.How: Via dedicated mobile apps or our website.",GOPPROF-01
How will your product solve users’ main problems?,GOPPROF-01
Here’s an example of how to go about this portion of the PRD: ,GOPPROF-01
"User Need: User needs to find a parking spot for their vehicle.Resolution: SafePark can use the users’ phone’s GPS to find the closest unoccupied parking spot. Only legal parking spots will be shown. User Need: User needs to know how much parking would cost in a given location.Resolution: In the premium version, users can see how much a parking spot costs, in 15 minute increments, in locations all over the city. User Need: Tourists need to find parking and don’t know where they can park.Resolution: SafePark can use the users’ phone’s GPS to find the closest unoccupied parking spot. Only legal parking spots will be shown. User Need: Driver gets frequent parking tickets and fines for unknowingly parking in illegal parking spaces.Resolution: SafePark use the users’ phone’s GPS to find the closest unoccupied parking spot. Only legal parking spots will be shown.",GOPPROF-01

"Here, you can describe the key functions users can carry out with your product. This section should focus on functionality rather than design.",GOPPROF-01
Take a look at this sample product requirements document user stories section:,GOPPROF-01
"All premium users will have access to freemium version features, but only premium users can use additional features. 1. As a user, I can create an account linked to my email.2. As a premium user, my account can save a list of parking spots that my phone will search for first.3. As a user, I can see parking spots all over the city, both occupied and unoccupied on the website version.4. As a premium user, all parking spots will have a cost displayed in 15-minute increments in locations all over the city.5. As a user, my phone will show me the nearest parking spot using GPS geolocation.6. As a premium user, the website and phone versions will alert me to events in the city that may affect my preferred parking locations.7. As a user, my phone allows me to alert other users to empty parking spots.8. As a premium user, I can alert other premium users to empty spots, which they will receive before non-premium users.",GOPPROF-01
"List your main competitors, and describe their market position and product availability in this section. ",GOPPROF-01
"Writing this information down will not only give you a better idea of the market you’re entering, but knowing more about your competitors can help you consider how else you could improve your product for better reach, product market fit, or edge over your competition.",GOPPROF-01
Here’s our example of competitor research on a PRD based on our fictional SafePark brand:,GOPPROF-01

"Here, we’re going to walk through the technical processes behind the product and its basic capabilities. The more you know about what you’d like to happen or how your product should work, the easier it will be for your developer to help you.",GOPPROF-01
"If you’re unsure about the complex technical aspects, however, don’t fret. Try to be as clear as possible while being open to suggestions and feedback.",GOPPROF-01
"Below, we’re going to write tech specs and a list of technical processes from the point of view of a founder who might not know how the development works but has an idea of what they want. In this section, points 6-8 are examples of a feature that wasn’t mentioned before. The founder hopes to implement these features but isn’t sure about their feasibility.",GOPPROF-01
Have a look at our example product requirements document process and specs section:,GOPPROF-01
"SafePark Technical Process and Specs1. The app needs to be able to access geolocation and GPS services from the users’ phone in order to find nearby parking spots.2. The app should be able to connect to public parking APIs in order to tap into information on public parking, such as rates and availability. Some major cities, like San Francisco, have their city parking spot information available online. If SafePark can sync with that information, it adds to the number of legal, open spots available.3. The app should be able to access privately owned lots as well to give more detailed information on parking rates.4. The app should have a function like Waze, where users can report open parking spots on the street. This will encourage user participation and increase the number of parking spots that users see.5. The app should be able to sync across mobile and desktop so that users can look up information at home, on their computers, and be able to access it on the go.6. Ideally, a user will open the app, press their “find me” button, and see the parking options nearest to them, color-coded by type: blue for user reported, yellow for free parking, green for private lots, and orange for public parking.7. Premium users will be able to see the rates for public and private parking closest to them. They will also be able to get preferential alerts, so the back-end needs a database of premium users.8. The user should have some sort of easy-to-find button to report an empty space, and quickly choose what kind of parking category it belongs to. The app will color-code the information automatically.",GOPPROF-01
"Here, talk about how you would like your product to be tested for quality assurance and documented before and after its release. ",GOPPROF-01
This will facilitate conversation between you and your development team about how you want to communicate and collaborate.,GOPPROF-01
"Here’s another set of samples (blue boxes) that, when combined, show a PRD section documenting SafePark’s release criteria:",GOPPROF-01
"Testing/QA: Before SafePark is released, I would like to complete alpha and beta testing to make sure there are no bugs, the GPS functions are accurate, the parking rates are displayed accurately, and the app does not crash, like those of my competitors.I will consult with my developer on how they will complete QA trial runs for the alpha and beta testing, as well as the final version before release. I will also discuss with them what happens if QA testing fails.In addition, I will talk to my developer about the time frames for alpha testing and then beta testing. With a launch date of six months from now, I would like alpha testing to be completed at least three months into the project, beta testing five months into the project, and a final version to be tested for a month prior to launch.",GOPPROF-01
Note: While you don’t have to know when exactly you want your product to be alpha or beta-tested — which you should plan to do to get user feedback and to better grasp your product-market fit — you should think about and discuss product testing and quality assurance issues with your developer.,GOPPROF-01
"Documentation: I would like to make sure that my developer documents their code religiously. While that may cost me more in terms of time spent on the project, I would like other developers working on this project in the future to be able to read changes to the code.This not only avoids technical debt — where choosing a short-term easy fix right now creates more problems down the road — especially if I decide to scale the product. Good documentation also ensures continuity between developers working on the project.I would also like to be updated on possible changes to features, either via a project management tool or email. I would like to be briefed on a bi-monthly basis, rather than simply view a finished product.Support: I would like to ask my developer what support will be offered after the initial product is built. I will also make sure that the developer I hire will be available on a standby basis (and will be compensated accordingly) for at least the first 48 hours after launch, to ensure that any unforeseen glitches will be taken care of.",GOPPROF-01
"Note: While not all products require extended support, you should consider what happens after your product is built and launched.",GOPPROF-01
"If you choose to hire a freelance developer and are worried about problems during launch, it’s worth making sure your developer will be available to help you or leave good documentation behind, after they are done building your product.",GOPPROF-01
"As for the 48-hour, post-launch standby, this is a semi-arbitrary time period that is not strictly necessary. In this hypothetical, we suggested a 48-hour standby period in case there are problems after launch that need immediate resolution.",GOPPROF-01
"Although you have tested this product, there could be unforeseen issues, server overloading, etc., that can happen if the product is very popular and the back-end systems are not prepared to handle it. Therefore, it would be safer to ensure someone is on hand to help.",GOPPROF-01
"Obviously, there is always the chance of bugs and glitches, even after extensive testing, but if something is going to go wrong, there is a greater chance it’s going to go wrong immediately after launch.",GOPPROF-01

"Congratulations, we’ve just completed one version of a product requirements document template!",GOPPROF-01
"A few words of advice before you go off to make your million-dollar app a reality, though.",GOPPROF-01
"First, don’t worry if you don’t know any programming lingo or terminology. If you’re unsure how to describe what you want to happen to your developer, you can write a user story, which basically describes what you want the customer to experience.",GOPPROF-01
"Second, do let your developer know what you’d like your app to do (in general terms). If you know what features you want, divide them into two categories: requirements (must-haves) and bonuses (nice-to-haves, but not requirements).",GOPPROF-01
"Keep in mind that not all features are created equal (or feasible). However, having made this list will at least force you to think about what you really need to bring the product to market.",GOPPROF-01
"Finally, when interviewing a developer, ask which of your required or bonus features can be short-circuited, i.e., which features can be carried out using a basic script for your prototype. This will allow you to decide whether you want to try this feature at all before investing too much time into it.",GOPPROF-01
"Remember, the more you know about what you want and the more specific you are in your PRD, the easier it is for a software developer to help you. ",GOPPROF-01
